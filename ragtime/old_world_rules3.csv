Overview of the Game,0,https://tow.whfb.app/overview-of-the-game,"Rulebook, p. 91",This summarises the sequence you will follow when playing a game of Warhammer: the Old World and points you to the relevant parts of the book that explain how each stage works.Muster Your Forces!Choose ScenarioSet Up The BattlefieldDeploy ArmiesTo Battle!Aftermath
Muster Your Forces!,1,https://tow.whfb.app/overview-of-the-game/muster-your-forces,"Rulebook, p. 91","To play a game of Warhammer: the Old World, each player will need an army to command, so the first thing to do is assemble your forces. You can simply use all the models in your collection, but most players use points values and army lists to ensure their forces are evenly matched for a closely fought battle. This system is explained in the Warhammer Armies."
Choose Scenario,2,https://tow.whfb.app/overview-of-the-game/choose-scenario,"Rulebook, p. 91","The Warhammer Battles section presents six pitched battles. Each of these explains how to play a slightly different type of battle, ranging from a straightforward clash of forces to a fight in a mountain pass or the defence of a watchtower. Players can roll a dice to decide which pitched battle they will play or simply choose one."
Set up the Battlefield,3,https://tow.whfb.app/overview-of-the-game/set-up-the-battlefield,"Rulebook, p. 91","Next, you will need a battlefield, which can be set up on any flat surface, be it the kitchen table, the floor or a dedicated wargames table. The players set up terrain for their armies to fight over, representing woods, fortified watchtowers and other features that make up the landscape of the Warhammer world. How to do this is covered in the Warhammer Battles section."
Deploy Armies,4,https://tow.whfb.app/overview-of-the-game/deploy-armies,"Rulebook, p. 91","The rival armies are deployed facing each other across the battlefield, ready to fight. Details of how to deploy can be found in the Warhammer Battles section. Each of the pitched battle scenarios includes a map showing where on the battlefield each player can place their models, and tells which side will take the first turn of the game."
To Battle!,5,https://tow.whfb.app/overview-of-the-game/to-battle,"Rulebook, p. 91","The players fight out the battle, each taking turns in which their army will move, shoot, wield mighty magic and fight vicious combat. All of this is done using the rules that follow. These rules start with basic rules that apply to all models and cover the standard sequence of moving, shooting, fighting and more. Each pitched battle also explains how many rounds to play before the game ends."
Aftermath,6,https://tow.whfb.app/overview-of-the-game/aftermath,"Rulebook, p. 91","In the aftermath of the battle, the players must work out which side stands victorious. Each pitched battle explains how to work out who has won the game. In most cases, the victor is the side that has destroyed more of the enemy and so it is often obvious who has won, as the enemy army lies in tatters – dead or fleeing! Other battles are decided by claiming objectives, such as seizing enemy banners or capturing a watchtower. Whatever the outcome, only a rematch will give you the chance for further glory or sweet revenge."
General Principles,7,https://tow.whfb.app/general-principles,"Rulebook, p. 92","Before going further, it is worth establishing some general principles regarding some commonly used terms, conventions, dice and other accessories, and the game of Warhammer in general."
Take-backs & Changing One's Mind,8,https://tow.whfb.app/general-principles/take-backs-and-changing-ones-mind,"Rulebook, p. 92","It is not uncommon for players of any game to occasionally second guess themselves, saying they are about to do something before immediately changing their mind. Players should be tolerant of this in their opponents, as they will likely do it themselves.However, once dice have been rolled for any reason, or a move committed to and made, players must abide by their decision; they can no longer go back and change anything that came before the dice roll or the act of moving!"
Moving Through Units,9,https://tow.whfb.app/general-principles/moving-through-units,"Rulebook, p. 92","As a general rule, no unit can move through another unit, though there are exceptions. For example, a fleeing unit may be obliged to move through another unit.Alternatively, the corner of a unit may have no choice but to move through another unit during a manoeuvre. In such cases, it is acceptable for one unit to pass through another and the rules will make allowance for this."
Measurement (General Principles),10,https://tow.whfb.app/general-principles/measurement-general-principles,"Rulebook, p. 92","In games of Warhammer: the Old World, all distances are measured in inches (""), using a ruler or tape measure, and can be measured at any time. Distances between models and all other objects (which can be other models, terrain features and so on) are always measured from the closest point on one base to the closest point on the other base (see diagram below).For example, if any part of a model's base is within 6"" of the base of an enemy model, the two models are said to be within 6"" of each other.Sometimes, units will be mounted on movement trays for ease. Nevertheless, always use the model's base, and not the movement tray, as the reference point when taking your measurements.Fig 92.1 - The distance between two units is measured between the closest points. Therefore, the distance between unit A and unit B is 4"", and the distance between unit A and the Dragon (unit C) is 5""."
Directly Towards & Directly Away,11,https://tow.whfb.app/general-principles/directly-towards-and-directly-away,"Rulebook, p. 92","A unit may be required to move directly towards, or directly away from, another unit or object. To do so, draw an imaginary line between the centre of the moving unit and the centre of the unit or object it is moving towards or away from. As the unit moves, its centre moves along this line."
Dice,12,https://tow.whfb.app/general-principles/dice,"Rulebook, p. 93",Warhammer: the Old World uses dice of different types to determine the outcome of various actions and events. These are:D6Artillery & Scatter DiceDice RollingModifying Dice RollsNatural RollsRolling OffRe-rolls
D6,13,https://tow.whfb.app/general-principles/d6,"Rulebook, p. 93","The most frequently used dice is a regular six-sided dice, marked 1 to 6. It is common for the '6' to be replaced by a logo on many dice.D3The rules may call for a D3 to be rolled, but an actual three-sided dice is not necessary. To roll a D3, simply roll a D6 and half the result, rounding fractions up."
Artillery & Scatter Dice,14,https://tow.whfb.app/general-principles/artillery-and-scatter-dice,"Rulebook, p. 93","Warhammer: the Old World uses two special dice: the Artillery dice (marked 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and Misfire) and a Scatter dice (marked with arrows and Hit! symbols). These are often used together to represent the effects of war machines. Sometimes, the Scatter dice is used with one or more D6 to determine a random direction and distance."
Dice Rolling,15,https://tow.whfb.app/general-principles/dice-rolling,"Rulebook, p. 93","During a game, you will be required to make many different dice rolls. The rules will often use a specific term or abbreviation to describe the dice roll. These are defined as follows:Single Dice RollsIf the rules say 'roll a D6', simply roll a single six-sided dice.Target Number RollsThe rules will often require you to roll a specific number followed by a '+'. This is a 'target number roll'. If you are required to roll a 4+, for example, a roll of 4, 5 or 6 on a D6 would be a success, but a roll of 1, 2 or 3 would not.Multiple Dice RollsThe rules may require you to roll 2D6, 3D6 and so forth. In such cases, simply roll the number of D6 indicated and add the results together. This is a multiple dice roll."
Modifying Dice Rolls,16,https://tow.whfb.app/general-principles/modifying-dice-rolls,"Rulebook, p. 93","To modify a dice roll, simply roll the dice and then add or subtract the modifier(s) shown, effectively changing the result of the roll. If the rules ever instruct you to divide a dice roll, any fractions are rounded up, unless the rules state otherwise. Modifiers are applied after division or multiplication."
Natural Rolls,17,https://tow.whfb.app/general-principles/natural-rolls,"Rulebook, p. 93","The term 'natural' roll describes the actual number shown once a dice has been rolled. In other words, a natural roll is the result before any modifiers are applied."
Rolling Off,18,https://tow.whfb.app/general-principles/rolling-off,"Rulebook, p. 93","The rules may call for players to 'roll-off'. To do this, each player rolls a dice (usually a D6) and the highest score wins. In the case of a tie, roll again unless otherwise instructed."
Re-rolls,19,https://tow.whfb.app/general-principles/re-rolls,"Rulebook, p. 93","In some situations, the rules may allow you to re-roll a dice. This is exactly what it sounds like – pick up the dice and roll it again. You must accept the result of the re-roll, even if it is worse than the first. No single dice can be re-rolled more than once, regardless of the source of the re-roll.If you re-roll a multiple dice roll, you must re-roll all of the dice, unless the rule granting the re-roll specifies otherwise."
The Most Important Rule,20,https://tow.whfb.app/general-principles/the-most-important-rule,"Rulebook, p. 93","Warhammer: the Old World is a complex game and, as such, players will occasionally disagree in their interpretation of the rules. Should disagreements arise, players are encouraged to look up the rule(s) in question, reach an agreement and move on. Should this prove impossible, a roll-off should determine whose interpretation will apply for the remainder of the game. What matters more than any rule is that players enjoy their game and that rivalries remain friendly!"
Templates,21,https://tow.whfb.app/general-principles/templates,"Rulebook, p. 95","In Warhammer: the Old World, templates are used to represent the effect of certain weapons:Blast TemplatesA blast template is a round template 3"" or 5"" in diameter.Flame TemplatesA flame template is a teardrop-shaped template, approximately 8"" in length.These templates are used to determine which models are hit by an attack that has an area of effect or blast radius. If an attack uses a template, the rules will explain how to position it, and how it might scatter."
Risk of Being Hit,22,https://tow.whfb.app/general-principles/risk-of-being-hit,"Rulebook, p. 95","To determine which models risk being hit by a template, hold it in place and look to see which models' bases lie underneath it:A model whose base lies completely underneath a template, or partially underneath the central hole of a blast template, is hit automatically.A model whose base lies partially underneath a template is hit on a D6 roll of 4+."
Scatter,23,https://tow.whfb.app/general-principles/scatter,"Rulebook, p. 95","A rule may call for an object to be placed and then 'scattered'. To do so:Place the object on the battlefield, as instructed by the rule. Roll a Scatter dice to determine a direction, and any other dice required by the rule to determine a distance (in inches).If a 'Hit!' is rolled on the Scatter dice, the object does not move – leave it in place and resolve the rest of the rule.If an arrow is rolled, move the object the distance (in inches) indicated by the roll of the other dice in the direction indicated, ignoring intervening terrain, units, etc., unless the rule states otherwise. With the object's final position determined, resolve the rest of the rule.Fig 95.1 - The Scatter dice shows a Hit, so the Blast template does not move - the D6 roll is ignored.Fig 95.2 - The Scatter dice shows an arrow, so the Blast template is moved in that direction the distance shown on the D6."
Unusual Situations,24,https://tow.whfb.app/general-principles/unusual-situations,"Warhammer: The Old World FAQ & Errata, p. 8","This rule does not appear in the rulebook but is included in the Warhammer: The Old World FAQ & Errata and is worth repeating here.Warhammer: the Old World is a complex game of manoeuvre and counter manoeuvre between tightly formed battle lines of densely packed infantry and cavalry. It is to be expected that unusual situations will arise when units get in one another's way, interfering with movement, shooting, combat and so forth.To deal with this, we encourage players to resolve uncertainties in a way that keeps the game flowing, or to seek the opinion of an impartial third party (at an organised event, where such situations can take on greater significance, this is the role of the event organiser or the umpires, and players should always defer to the ruling of such an official, as is right and honourable – only the most dastardly rapscallion would argue with such an exemplar of the hobby).If such resolution is impossible, the simplest solution is to rule that the unit cannot do the thing, by which we mean it cannot make the move, cannot take the shot, and so forth. As stated in The Most Important Rule, what matters more than any rule is that players enjoy their game and that rivalries remain friendly!"
Model Profiles,25,https://tow.whfb.app/model-profiles,"Rulebook, p. 96","The Citadel miniatures used to play games of Warhammer: the Old World are referred to as 'models' in the rules that follow. Models represent a huge variety of troops, each with its own skills and capabilities. To reflect this, each model has its own characteristics profile."
Characteristics Profile,26,https://tow.whfb.app/model-profiles/characteristics-profile,"Rulebook, p. 96",Each model in Warhammer: the Old World has a profile of nine characteristics:MWSBSSTWIALdSoldier of the Empire433331317These are used to describe the various attributes of different models. All characteristics are rated on a scale from 0 to 10 – they cannot go below 0 and only in the rarest of cases will they rise above 10. These characteristics are:Movement (M)Weapon Skill (WS)Ballistic Skill (BS)Strength (S)Toughness (T)Wounds (W)Initiative (I)Attacks (A)Leadership (Ld)
Movement (M),27,https://tow.whfb.app/model-profiles/movement,"Rulebook, p. 96","This shows the number of inches a model can move on the battlefield under normal circumstances. For example, a Man with a Movement of 4 (M4) can move up to 4""."
Weapon Skill (WS),28,https://tow.whfb.app/model-profiles/weapon-skill,"Rulebook, p. 96","This defines how skilled a warrior is with their weapons, or how determined and vicious a monster is."
Ballistic Skill (BS),29,https://tow.whfb.app/model-profiles/ballistic-skill,"Rulebook, p. 96",This shows how accomplished a model is with ranged weapons such as bows or handguns.
Strength (S),30,https://tow.whfb.app/model-profiles/strength,"Rulebook, p. 96",Strength gives a measure of how strong a model is and how easily it can hurt an enemy it has struck in combat.
Toughness (T),31,https://tow.whfb.app/model-profiles/toughness,"Rulebook, p. 96","This is a measure of a model's ability to resist physical damage and pain, and reflects such factors as the resilience of a creature's flesh and its ability to shrug off injury."
Wounds (W),32,https://tow.whfb.app/model-profiles/wounds,"Rulebook, p. 96",This shows how much damage a model can take before it succumbs to its injuries. Most human-sized models have a single Wound. Large monsters and mighty heroes able to withstand more damage will usually have more Wounds.
Initiative (I),33,https://tow.whfb.app/model-profiles/initiative,"Rulebook, p. 96","This indicates how fast a model can react. In combat, Initiative dictates the order in which models fight."
Attacks (A),34,https://tow.whfb.app/model-profiles/attacks,"Rulebook, p. 96","This shows the number of attacks a model makes in combat. Most models have a single Attack. Elite troops, monsters or heroes may be able to strike several times and will usually have more Attacks."
Leadership (Ld),35,https://tow.whfb.app/model-profiles/leadership,"Rulebook, p. 96","Leadership shows how courageous, determined and self-controlled a model is. A creature with a low Leadership characteristic is very unruly or cowardly, to say the least!"
Split Profiles (Model Profiles),36,https://tow.whfb.app/model-profiles/split-profiles-model-profiles,"Rulebook, p. 97","Some models have two or more rows on their characteristics profile, often with gaps in each (shown as a dash ' - '). Each row represents a different model, combined together into a single profile. For example, one row might represent a rider, the next their mount. Split profiles are explained in greater detail in the advanced rules."
Characteristics of Zero,37,https://tow.whfb.app/model-profiles/characteristics-of-zero,"Rulebook, p. 97","If a model has a characteristic of '0', it has no ability whatsoever in what the characteristic represents. This is seen most often with Ballistic Skill, as many models simply lack the ability to make any form of ranged attack.If any model or object has a Weapon Skill of 0 then it is unable to defend itself in combat, and any blows struck against it will therefore automatically hit. If at any time a model's Strength, Toughness or Wounds characteristic is reduced to 0, it is slain and removed from play."
Characteristic Tests,38,https://tow.whfb.app/model-profiles/characteristic-tests,"Rulebook, p. 97","A model will sometimes be called upon to make a characteristic test. Such a test could be made against any characteristic the model has. For example, a Toughness test is a characteristic test.To make a characteristic test, roll a D6 and compare the result to the relevant characteristic on the model's profile. If the result is equal to or less than the value of the characteristic, the test is passed. If, however, the result is greater, the test has been failed.Where a model (or unit) has more than one value for the same characteristic, use the highest value.Automatic Pass and FailWhen making a characteristic test a natural roll of 6 is always a failure, and a natural 1 is always a success, regardless of any other modifiers. Additionally, if the model has a characteristic of 0 or ' - ' it automatically fails the test."
Leadership Tests,39,https://tow.whfb.app/model-profiles/leadership-tests,"Rulebook, p. 97","At various times, a model or unit might be called upon to make a Leadership test, or to otherwise test against Leadership in some way.To make a Leadership test, roll 2D6. If the result is equal to or less than the model's Leadership value, then the test has been passed. If the result is greater than the model's Leadership value, the test has been failed. This will all too often result in the unit fleeing.Whenever Leadership is used, a unit that contains models with different Leadership values will always use the highest – warriors naturally look to the most steadfast of their number for guidance.Automatic Pass and FailWhen making a Leadership test a natural roll of 12 (i.e., rolling a double 6) is always considered to be a fail, regardless of any modifiers that might apply, whereas a natural roll of 2 (i.e., rolling a double 1) is always considered to be a pass."
Modifying Characteristics,40,https://tow.whfb.app/model-profiles/modifying-characteristics,"Rulebook, p. 97","The rules will often call for a characteristic to be modified. To do this, simply add or subtract the modifier(s) shown to the characteristic, effectively increasing or decreasing the value."
Other Model Information,41,https://tow.whfb.app/model-profiles/other-model-information,"Rulebook, p. 98","In addition to its profile, a model's rules include other information vital to the game. What this is varies from model to model, and in many cases not all of the following information will be included for every model (not every model can use magic, for example)."
Points Value,42,https://tow.whfb.app/model-profiles/points-value,"Rulebook, p. 98","Almost every model will have a points value given within its profile. Points values reflect a model's worth within its army.Most models have a basic points value that increases as various optional items of equipment (weapons, armour, magic items, for example) are added. By adding together the points values of all of the models you have selected, you find the total points value of your army. Knowing this enables players to play evenly matched battles.Points values and the rules for building an army are explained in greater detail in the Warhammer Armies section."
Troop Type,43,https://tow.whfb.app/model-profiles/troop-type,"Rulebook, p. 98","All models have a troop type given as part of their rules. There are five broad categories of troop type: Infantry, Cavalry, Chariots, Monsters and War Machines, each of which is further divided into sub-categories.Additionally, some models have the word 'Character' in brackets after their troop type. This denotes that the model is a character, one of the brave and powerful heroes that lead an army.Troop types and their rules are explained in brief and in greater detail in the Advanced Rules. Characters are explained in greater detail in the Characters section."
Base Size,44,https://tow.whfb.app/model-profiles/base-size,"Rulebook, p. 98","With very few exceptions, all models used in a game of Warhammer: the Old World should be mounted upon a square or rectangular base, the dimensions of which are given here in millimetres (mm). Sometimes, a range of sizes will be given. In such cases, the base the model is provided with is the correct base to use.Base Sizes (Designer's note)As stated above, all models used in a game of Warhammer: the Old World should be mounted upon a correctly sized and shaped base. However, many players will have in their collections older models, the base sizes of which can vary. Whilst it is possible to play a game of Warhammer: the Old World without needing to re-base such models, in Matched Play events players are required to use correctly based models to ensure all aspects of the game are as fair as possible. To assist with re-basing an existing collection, separate bases are available as part of the Citadel Miniatures range."
Unit Size,45,https://tow.whfb.app/model-profiles/unit-size,"Rulebook, p. 98","This tells you how many models of this type form a unit. Most often, this will be presented as a number followed by a '+' symbol, 5+ for example, indicating that a unit made up of this type of model must contain at least five models.In some cases, this may be a number range, 5-30 for example, indicating that a unit made up of this type of model must contain at least five models, but no more than thirty. In other cases, most notably in the case of characters, chariots or monsters, this will be presented as a simple number, usually a '1', telling you exactly how many models make up the unit."
Armour Value (Model Profiles),46,https://tow.whfb.app/model-profiles/armour-value-model-profiles,"Rulebook, p. 98","Most models wear armour, and the type of armour they wear determines their armour value. However, in the case of large models with multiple riders or crew, such as monsters and chariots, an armour value is not always easy to determine. To avoid confusion, and if appropriate, such models will have an armour value given within their rules."
Equipment,47,https://tow.whfb.app/model-profiles/equipment,"Rulebook, p. 99","Almost all models carry equipment of some sort, from a simple sword or axe to an array of arms and armour. The equipment a model carries will be listed and is factored into its points value. Many models, particularly monsters, will have natural weapons listed as equipment, their claws, teeth and even breath weapons being the weapons they 'carry' into battle.The rules for many of the weapons and armour carried and worn by models can be found in the Weapons of War section."
Magic,48,https://tow.whfb.app/model-profiles/magic,"Rulebook, p. 99","In Warhammer: the Old World, many models represent powerful Wizards, able to bend the Winds of Magic to their will. Whilst not all models are able to wield such powers, those that can have this information within their rules. This details the Lore(s) of Magic they can choose spells from and their Level of Wizardry.Magic is explained in greater detail Magic section."
Options,49,https://tow.whfb.app/model-profiles/options,"Rulebook, p. 99","Many models have a number of options given. This includes a number of weapons they may be armed with, upgrades to their armour, and so forth. In the case of those models that form units, most have the option to upgrade some of their number to become command models."
Special Rules,50,https://tow.whfb.app/model-profiles/special-rules,"Rulebook, p. 99","In addition to the special rules associated with their troop type, many models have one or more special rules. These fall into three broad categories:Universal Special Rules: These are rules that appear in all armies, a full list of these can be found  in the Special Rules section. If a model has one or more universal special rules, their names will be listed as part of its rules.Army Special Rules: These are special rules unique to the army the model belongs to. If a model has one or more army special rules, their names will be listed as part of its rules.Unique Special Rules: Some models have special rules unique to them. If a model has one or more unique special rules, these will be listed as part of its rules.Note that army and unique special rules are included within each army list."
Magic Items,51,https://tow.whfb.app/model-profiles/magic-items,"Rulebook, p. 99","Some models, notably named characters, are equipped with their own unique magic items. Where this is the case, these items will be described and their rules given along with the model's."
Unique Equipment,52,https://tow.whfb.app/model-profiles/unique-equipment,"Rulebook, p. 99","Some models are equipped with items that are unique to them, equipment not found on any other models. In such cases, these items will be described and their rules given along with the model's."
Forming Units,53,https://tow.whfb.app/forming-units,"Rulebook, p. 100","The models that make up your army must be formed into 'units' before battle commences, ideally when writing your muster list. A unit usually consists of several models of the same type that have banded together and adopted a specific formation.Additionally, single, powerful models such as a character, a chariot or a Dragon, a war machine and its crew, and so on, are also considered to be a 'unit'. Therefore, whenever the rules that follow refer to 'units', this also includes units of one model."
Formation Types,54,https://tow.whfb.app/forming-units/formation-types,"Rulebook, p. 100","All units must adopt a formation. The type of formation a unit adopts will influence how it acts in battle; how it moves, how it fights, and so on. Each type of formation has its own rules.The type(s) of formation a unit can adopt are indicated by a special rule of the same name. Models with more than one such special rule may choose their formation during deployment, and may change it and adopt a different formation by reforming during the game.Close Order formations are by far the most usual. Therefore, the core 'how to play' rules focus upon such units. Examples of more unusual types of formation include Skirmish and Open Order, the rules for which are covered in the advanced rules section. Additionally, some army lists introduce special formation types unique to them."
Close Order Formation,55,https://tow.whfb.app/forming-units/close-order-formation,"Rulebook, p. 100","A unit arrayed in serried ranks is said to be in a 'Close Order' formation. A unit in Close Order consists of two or more models that are arranged in base contact with each other, edge-to-edge and front corner to front corner, as shown in Fig 100.1.All models in such a unit must face the same direction. In addition, the models must be arranged into a formation that consists of one or more horizontal rows called ranks, and a number of vertical rows called files (from this formation comes the term 'rank and file').As far as possible, there must be the same number of models in each rank. Where this is not possible, it must be the rear rank that has fewer models. Once formed into a unit, the models move and fight as a single entity for the entire battle.Fig 100.1"
Unit Shape (Close Order),56,https://tow.whfb.app/forming-units/unit-shape-close-order,"Rulebook, p. 101","The shape of a unit in Close Order is also important as such units gain bonuses in certain situations. Based upon this, such units can be said to be in Combat Order or in Marching Column."
Combat Order (Close Order),57,https://tow.whfb.app/forming-units/combat-order-close-order,"Rulebook, p. 101","A Close Order formation that is wider than it is deep (i.e., that has more models per rank than per file, as shown in Fig 101.1) or that is square (i.e., has the same number of models per file as per rank) is said to be in Combat Order. Such units are able to count a Rank Bonus in certain situations:Rank BonusIf a unit in Close Order formation is wide enough, it can claim a Rank Bonus of +1 for each rank behind the first, up to the maximum determined by its troop type:How many models a rank must contain to claim a Rank Bonus, as well as the maximum Rank Bonus a unit can claim, is determined by its troop type.Certain special rules may increase the Rank Bonus a unit can claim beyond the maximum normally allowed by its troop type.Note that this bonus can be claimed for an incomplete rear rank, as long as there are sufficient models in it. However, if your unit has become Disrupted it cannot claim a Rank Bonus.Combat Result BonusWhilst in Combat Order, a Close Order formation with a Unit Strength of 5 or more may claim a bonus of +1 combat result point.Fig 101.1 - This unit is wider than it is deep (i.e., it has more models per rank than it has per file). Therefore, this unit is said to be in 'Combat Order'."
Marching Column,58,https://tow.whfb.app/forming-units/marching-column,"Rulebook, p. 101","A unit that is deeper than it is wide (i.e., that has more models per file than per rank, as shown in Fig 101.2) is said to be in Marching Column. A Marching Column cannot claim a Rank Bonus and cannot make a charge move, but may triple its Movement characteristic when Marching.Fig 101.2 - This unit is deeper than it is wide (i.e., it has more models per file than it has per rank). Therefore, this unit is said to be in 'Marching Column'."
Disrupted Units,59,https://tow.whfb.app/forming-units/disrupted-units,"Rulebook, p. 101",Disruption represents a unit having lost some of its cohesion. A unit becomes Disrupted if:It is engaged in the flank or rear by an enemy unit with a Unit Strength of five or more.It ends its movement with a quarter (25%) or more of its models within difficult terrain or if it is straddling a low linear obstacle.A Disrupted unit cannot claim a Rank Bonus.Note that enemy Skirmishers do not cause Disruption.
Removing Casualties,60,https://tow.whfb.app/removing-casualties,"Rulebook, p. 102","Throughout the course of a game, models will suffer 'wounds' from enemy attacks (in combat, from shooting, from magic spells and so on). Some of these wounds will be saved by a model’s armour, but others will not.For each unsaved wound a model suffers, it loses one Wound from its profile. When a model is reduced to zero Wounds, it becomes a casualty and is removed from play."
Single Wound Models,61,https://tow.whfb.app/removing-casualties/single-wound-models,"Rulebook, p. 102","Most models have only a single Wound on their profile. When this is lost, they are removed from the battlefield as a casualty."
Multiple Wound Models,62,https://tow.whfb.app/removing-casualties/multiple-wound-models,"Rulebook, p. 102","Some models have more than one Wound on their profile. Should a unit of such models lose Wounds, you must remove as many whole models as possible. In other words, Wounds are lost by a single model until its Wounds characteristic is reduced to zero. Wounds are then lost by the next model, and so on. You cannot spread the loss of Wounds throughout the unit to avoid casualties.For example, a unit of Ogres, each with three Wounds on its profile (W3), loses five Wounds. One Ogre will lose all three of its Wounds and be removed as a casualty, and one Ogre will lose two Wounds, leaving it with only one Wound remaining."
Removing Casualties From Units,63,https://tow.whfb.app/removing-casualties/removing-casualties-from-units,"Rulebook, p. 102","When removing casualties, models are always removed from one end of the back rank, either left to right or from right to left, as the owning player prefers, ensuring where possible that the remaining models are adjacent to one another, as shown in Fig 102.1.Fig 102.1"
Stepping Forward,64,https://tow.whfb.app/removing-casualties/stepping-forward,"Rulebook, p. 102","Although models are removed from the back of their unit, very often the casualties will have fallen elsewhere, usually in the front or fighting rank. Removing models from the back of a unit represents warriors behind the front rank 'stepping forward' to fill gaps in the front rank.However, a model cannot make any form of attack (shooting or combat) during a phase in which it stepped forward. It is too busy clambering over the fallen bodies of its comrades."
Single Rank Units,65,https://tow.whfb.app/removing-casualties/single-rank-units,"Rulebook, p. 102","If a unit contains only a single rank, casualties must be removed evenly from either end of the rank."
Model & Unit Facing,66,https://tow.whfb.app/model-and-unit-facing,"Rulebook, p. 103","Most models have a front, flank and rear arc based on the direction they are facing. These arcs are used to determine what the model can see, and to determine the direction of an enemy charge.A model's front, flank and rear arcs extend out from the corners of its base at 45° angles, forming four 90° quadrants, as shown in Fig 103.1 below. A unit's facings are determined by the facing of its constituent models.Fig 103.1 - Whether a unit consists of one model or many, its facings are determined by its constituent models, as shown here.Models can only draw a line of sight to things that lie within their 'vision arc'. Unless stated otherwise, models have a 90° vision arc, corresponding to their front arc."
Line of Sight,67,https://tow.whfb.app/model-and-unit-facing/line-of-sight,"Rulebook, p. 103","You will often need to determine if one model or unit has a line of sight to another. To check a line of sight between models, stoop down to look from the model's point of view:If a straight, uninterrupted line can be drawn from within the model's vision arc to any part of the other model, there is a line of sight.If no such line can be drawn to the other model due to intervening terrain, or without crossing over or through another model, there is no line of sight.A model is always within its own vision arc and always has a line of sight to itself and its unit. If at least one model in a unit has a line of sight to at least one model from another unit, that unit can 'see' the other unit.Note that models and units always block line of sight. Therefore, it is normally only the models in the front rank of a unit that have a line of sight."
Obscured Line of Sight,68,https://tow.whfb.app/model-and-unit-facing/obscured-line-of-sight,"Rulebook, p. 103","Line of sight may be partly obscured by terrain features or by other models. In such cases, the other model or unit is said to be 'in cover'. To check if a model or unit is in cover, stoop down to look from the first model's point of view:If the other model or unit is fully visible, they are not in cover (i.e., they are 'in the open').If up to half of the other model or unit is obscured, they are in partial cover.If more than half of the other model or unit is obscured, they are in full cover.The benefits of partial and full cover are discussed in more detail under the rules for shooting."
Troop Types at a Glance,69,https://tow.whfb.app/troop-types-at-a-glance,"Rulebook, p. 104","As mentioned previously, all models have a troop type. These, along with the type of formation units of such models adopt, determine how they function throughout the rules (as well as providing an insight into the role such models fulfil upon the battlefield). Troop types and their rules are explained in greater detail in the advanced rules. The following sections present some brief but important information needed to better understand the core 'how to play' rules that follow."
Categories of Troop Type (at a Glance),70,https://tow.whfb.app/troop-types-at-a-glance/categories-of-troop-type-at-a-glance,"Rulebook, p. 104","There are five main categories of troop type, each of which is further divided into sub-categories. For example, particularly large Infantry fall into the Monstrous Infantry sub-category of Infantry. In such cases, when the rules refer to Infantry units, Monstrous Infantry must also follow those rules unless an exception is stated for Monstrous Infantry.A model’s troop type determines the minimum number of such models a rank must contain to claim a Rank Bonus, the maximum Rank Bonus a unit of such models is able to claim, and the Unit Strength of such a model, as shown on the Troop Type Table.InfantryInfantry includes all units of foot troops, be they Goblins, Men, Ogres, Trolls or any other of the myriad Warhammer races fighting on foot. Infantry forms the backbone of most armies and is split into four sub-categories: Regular Infantry, Heavy Infantry, Monstrous Infantry and Swarms.CavalryThe term cavalry refers to any riders mounted on war beasts – commonly warhorses or similar creatures. It can also include war beasts on their own as packs of animals which will often function in a manner more similar to cavalry than infantry. Cavalry is split into four sub-categories: Light Cavalry, Heavy Cavalry, Monstrous Cavalry and War Beasts.ChariotsA chariot is usually a wheeled war vehicle drawn into battle by beasts of some kind and crewed by warriors, armed to the teeth. This category can also include large objects, such as mobile altars, that are pushed along or carried. Chariots are split into two sub-categories: Light Chariots and Heavy Chariots.MonstersMonsters are the largest beings in the Warhammer world, creatures so powerful that they usually roam the battlefield alone. In spite of this, due to their size they function as Close Order units, rather than as Skirmishers. This category includes Dragons, Gryphons and so on. Monsters are split into two sub-categories: Monstrous Creatures and Behemoths.War MachinesWar machines such as cannon and bolt throwers are powerful units on the field of battle, able to pulverise whole regiments, breach stone walls or even slay fearsome monsters with a single, well-placed shot. This is a broad category with varied rules that cover the many different weapons to be found in the Warhammer world, the most commonly seen of which are dealt with in their own section."
Troop Type Table,71,https://tow.whfb.app/troop-types-at-a-glance/troop-type-table,"Rulebook, p. 105","This table summarises the most important information for each troop type. More detail is given in the Advanced Rules section. Referencing this table will help you to better understand some of the rules contained in the core 'how to play' rules.Troop TypeModels per Rank*Maximum Rank Bonus**Unit Strength per ModelInfantry—————————Regular Infantry5+21Heavy Infantry4+21Monstrous Infantry3+23Swarms--3Cavalry—————————Light Cavalry5+12Heavy Cavalry4+12Monstrous Cavalry3+13War Beasts5+11Chariots—————————Light Chariots3+13Heavy Chariots--5Monsters—————————Monstrous Creatures--As Starting WoundsBehemoths--As Starting WoundsWar Machines—————————War Machines--As Starting Wounds*Note that this is the minimum number required to claim a Rank Bonus. Ranks can contain more or fewer models as you wish, but in order for a rank to count towards Rank Bonus, it must contain at least this many models.**Note that in some cases the maximum Rank Bonus a unit can claim can be increased by special rules. The maximum Rank Bonus a unit can claim can also be reduced by its formation, by spell effects, or by terrain."
Unit Strength,72,https://tow.whfb.app/troop-types-at-a-glance/unit-strength,"Rulebook, p. 105","Sometimes, you may be required to work out the 'Unit Strength' of a unit. There are a number of reasons you might need to know this, for example, to determine if one of your units is outnumbered by an enemy. Simply counting the number of models does not account for the sheer power of large and ferocious creatures. Unit Strength represents this well.To determine Unit Strength, simply count the number of models currently in the unit and multiply this by the Unit Strength per model as shown on the Troop Type table."
Magic,73,https://tow.whfb.app/magic,"Rulebook, p. 106","The Warhammer world is an intrinsically magical place. In battle, magic is a force as real and potent as a sword blade, its use limited only by the imagination and skill of the Wizard that wields it. Magic can be a subtle force, infusing allies with strength and valour, or enemies with frailty and dread. More commonly, however, Wizards unshackle the raw power that lies at the heart of magic's chaotic nature, summoning hungry firestorms or devastating bolts of eldritch power.It is therefore only right that magic should form a core part of the game of Warhammer: the Old World as well. Wizards are able to cast spells of different types throughout the turn, and players must protect them accordingly, ensuring they are able to cast the right spell at the right moment, or to thwart the casting attempts of their rivals.That being the case, explaining how magic works early on is important and the following sections do just that. New players can skip over this section for now if they wish, focusing instead on the more mundane rules and returning to this section once a few games have been played."
Wizards,74,https://tow.whfb.app/magic/wizards,"Rulebook, p. 106","Only beings that possess awesome mental might can even hope to bend the powers of magic to their will. Lesser persons would be consumed in an instant, their souls torn apart by terrible energies. In Warhammer: the Old World, all models that can cast spells are known collectively as 'Wizards', although specific armies might use other terms. You may see names such as sorcerer, shaman or seer, for example, but all of these and others are considered to be types of Wizard."
Levels of Wizardry,75,https://tow.whfb.app/magic/levels-of-wizardry,"Rulebook, p. 106","Naturally, not all Wizards are equal – mastery of magic increases through dedicated practice (and, occasionally, through sheer luck). To represent this, Wizards are divided into four degrees of ability called 'Levels of Wizardry' (often shortened simply to 'Level' in the rules that follow). The higher a Wizard's Level, the greater their knowledge of magic:Level 1: Wizards of the first level are those of humble ability.Level 2: Wizards of the second level are experienced spellcasters.Level 3: Wizards of the third level are great sorcerers of a kind rarely seen.Level 4: Wizards of the fourth level are the mightiest of all Wizards, the very equal of crowned monarchs within the realms of sorcery."
Lores of Magic,76,https://tow.whfb.app/magic/lores-of-magic,"Rulebook, p. 106","The Lores of Magic are lists from which Wizards generate their spells. Each Lore of Magic represents a particular approach towards the study and use of magic, giving each its own character reflected by the spells within it. Different Wizards have access to different Lores of Magic.Accompanying every Wizard's profile you will find the Lore(s) of Magic they know. In some cases, it will be stated that they know spells from a single, given Lore of Magic, whilst in others it will be stated that they know spells from one of a number of given Lores of Magic. Where this is the case, you must choose one of these Lores when writing your muster list.The Lores of Magic most commonly seen in the Old World are presented in the Lores of Magicsection."
Spells & Spell Generation (Magic),77,https://tow.whfb.app/magic/spells-and-spell-generation-magic,"Rulebook, p. 106","See also: Spells & Spell GenerationPlayers randomly generate spells for each of their Wizards before armies are deployed. If your army contains more than one Wizard, you may generate spells for each in an order of your choosing.Each Lore of Magic contains seven spells: six numbered (1-6) and a seventh 'signature' spell. To determine the spells your Wizard knows, roll a number of D6 equal to their Level of Wizardry, re-rolling any duplicate results. The result(s) show which spell(s) your Wizard knows.If you wish, your Wizard may then discard one of these randomly generated spells and instead select the signature spell of their chosen Lore of Magic. Any number of Wizards in your army may do this."
Spell Categories,78,https://tow.whfb.app/magic/spell-categories,"Rulebook, p. 107",Spells fall into six categories. These determine during which phase of the game they can be cast. These are:EnchantmentHexConveyanceMagic MissilesMagical VortexAssailment
Enchantment,79,https://tow.whfb.app/magic/enchantment,"Rulebook, p. 107","These spells empower the caster's allies in some way. Enchantment spells that require a target can only target friendly units. Most often they affect friendly units, but may occasionally have an effect on enemy units. Casting the same Enchantment spell more than once on the same unit during the same turn has no further effect."
Hex,80,https://tow.whfb.app/magic/hex,"Rulebook, p. 107","The opposite of Enchantment spells, weakening the enemy in some way. Hex spells that require a target can only target enemy units. Most often they affect enemy units, but may occasionally have an effect on friendly units. Casting the same Hex spell more than once on the same unit during the same turn has no further effect.Note that bonuses and penalties from different Hex and Enchantment spells are cumulative, but cannot take any characteristic above 10 or below 1."
Conveyance,81,https://tow.whfb.app/magic/conveyance,"Rulebook, p. 107",These spells enable Wizards to enhance movement or transport units from place to place. Conveyance spells that require a target can only target friendly units. A unit cannot be affected by the same Conveyance spell more than once per turn.
Magic Missiles,82,https://tow.whfb.app/magic/magic-missiles,"Rulebook, p. 107",These are sorcerous projectiles hurled at the foe. Magic Missiles can only target enemy units and the Wizard must have a line of sight to the target. A successfully cast Magic Missile automatically hits its target; there is no need to make a roll To Hit.
Magical Vortex,83,https://tow.whfb.app/magic/magical-vortex,"Rulebook, p. 107","These are roiling globes of magical energy that travel across the battlefield. A Magical Vortex does not require a target – instead, it uses a round template which is placed on the battlefield, not touching the bases of any models, and with its central hole within the range given by the spell. Once placed, Magical Vortexes remain on the battlefield (unless they move off it).Some Magical Vortexes move at the start of each turn. If a Magical Vortex ever ends such a move over a unit, continue to move it in the same direction until it can be placed on the battlefield, not touching the bases of any models."
Assailment,84,https://tow.whfb.app/magic/assailment,"Rulebook, p. 107",These spells are deadly attacks that strike the foe without warning. Assailment spells can only be cast by Wizards that are engaged in combat and can only target enemy units that the caster is engaged in combat with. A successfully cast Assailment spell always hits its target; there is no need to make a roll To Hit.
Casting Spells,85,https://tow.whfb.app/magic/casting-spells,"Rulebook, p. 108","When a spell can be cast depends upon its type:Enchantment and Hex spells can be cast during the Conjuration sub-phase of your Strategy phase.Conveyance spells can be cast at any point during the Remaining Moves sub-phase of your Movement phase.Magic Missiles and Magical Vortex spells can be cast when a Wizard is chosen during your Shooting phase.Assailment spells can be cast when a Wizard fights during any Combat phase.A Wizard can only attempt to cast each of their spells once per turn. Wizards that are fleeing cannot cast spells. Unless stated otherwise, Wizards that are engaged in combat can only cast Assailment or range self spells.To cast a spell, a Wizard declares which spell they wish to cast and its target (if required)."
Choosing a Target,86,https://tow.whfb.app/magic/choosing-a-target,"Rulebook, p. 108","Unless stated otherwise, the following rules apply when choosing a target:The target must lie within the Wizard's vision arc, but the Wizard does not need a line of sight to the target.The target must lie within the spell's range.Spells cannot target units engaged in combat.Note that different spell categories and some individual spells waive some of these rules and/or introduce others."
Range 'Self' Spells,87,https://tow.whfb.app/magic/range-self-spells,"Rulebook, p. 108","Spells with a range of 'Self' do not require a target, instead being focused upon the casting Wizard. Some such spells have an 'aura' of effect, measured from the caster. As mentioned previously, a Wizard can cast a range 'self' spell whilst engaged in combat."
"Casting Roll, Casting Result & Casting Value",88,https://tow.whfb.app/magic/casting-roll-casting-result-and-casting-value,"Rulebook, p. 108","To cast a spell, you must make a 'Casting' roll. To make a Casting roll, roll 2D6. This represents the Wizard's attempts to draw raw magical power from the æther and shape it to their will.The casting Wizard's Level is then added to the result of this roll to give a 'casting result'. For example, if a Level 2 Wizard makes a Casting roll of 1 and 6, the total casting result would be 9 (1 + 6 = 7 for the Casting roll, plus 2 for the Level of Wizardry).Keep the dice in front of you for the moment – the scores will be needed if your opponent makes a dispel attempt.Each spell has an associated 'casting value'. Spells with a higher casting value have greater effect, but require more power:If the casting result equals or exceeds the spell's casting value, the spell is successfully cast (though your opponent may subsequently dispel it).If the casting result is less than the casting value, the spell is not cast."
Magic Resistance (-X) (Magic),89,https://tow.whfb.app/magic/magic-resistance-magic,"Rulebook, p. 108","Some models have the Magic Resistance (-X) special rule, making them resistant to the magic of their enemies. The Casting roll of any spell (including Bound spells) that targets an enemy unit that includes one or more models with this special rule suffers a modifier, as shown in brackets after the name of this special rule (shown here as '-X').Note that this special rule is not cumulative. If two or more models in a unit have this special rule, use the highest modifier."
Miscasts & Perfect Invocations,90,https://tow.whfb.app/magic/miscasts-and-perfect-invocations,"Rulebook, p. 109","Should a Wizard mispronounce a single word, the magic they are wielding might shatter its bindings in a burst of energy.

Perfect Invocations,91,https://tow.whfb.app/magic/perfect-invocations,"Rulebook, p. 109","If a natural double 6 is rolled when making a Casting roll, the spell is cast regardless of its casting value or of any modifiers that may apply to the Casting roll. A perfect invocation cannot be dispelled."
Miscast,92,https://tow.whfb.app/magic/miscast,"Rulebook, p. 109","If a natural double 1 is rolled when making a Casting roll, regardless of the casting result, it has been 'miscast' and, unless stated otherwise, is not cast.

Bound Spells,94,https://tow.whfb.app/magic/bound-spells,"Rulebook, p. 109","Some models have 'Bound' spells, which may be contained within a magic item or given by a special rule, and which they can cast in the usual manner. If a 'Power Level' is given, this is added to the result of the Casting roll to give the casting result. If no Power Level is given, nothing is added – the result of the Casting roll is itself the casting result. When casting a Bound spell, there is no risk of a miscast or chance of a perfect invocation.You may attempt to dispel a Bound spell as usual. Magic items that dispel or destroy spells work as normal against Bound spells. When dispelling a Bound spell, there is no risk of being outclassed in the art.A model can only cast a single Bound spell per phase. Possessing a Bound spell does not make a model a Wizard."
Dispel,95,https://tow.whfb.app/magic/dispel,"Rulebook, p. 110","Whenever your opponent casts a spell, you can make a dispel attempt (unless, of course, the spell was cast with a perfect invocation). The type of dispel you attempt will affect its chances."
Types of Dispel,96,https://tow.whfb.app/magic/types-of-dispel,"Rulebook, p. 110","Before making a dispel attempt, you must first decide if one of your Wizards will attempt a Wizardly Dispel, or if you will trust to fate and attempt a Fated Dispel."
Wizardly Dispel,97,https://tow.whfb.app/magic/wizardly-dispel,"Rulebook, p. 110","To attempt a Wizardly dispel, nominate a single Wizard in your army that is within 'Dispel range' of the Wizard that cast the spell.

Fated Dispel,98,https://tow.whfb.app/magic/fated-dispel,"Rulebook, p. 110","Once per turn, if you do not have any Wizards able to make a Wizardly dispel attempt, or if you wish to avoid the risk, you may instead attempt a Fated dispel."

If you are attempting a Fated dispel, nothing is added – the result of the Dispel roll is itself the dispel result:If the dispel result exceeds the casting result, the spell is successfully dispelled and immediately ends.If the dispel result is equal to or less than the casting result, the dispel attempt has failed.

Unbinding,101,https://tow.whfb.app/magic/unbinding,"Rulebook, p. 110","If a natural double 6 is rolled when attempting any type of dispel, the magic unbinds and the spell is dispelled and immediately ends, regardless of the casting result.Note that a perfect invocation cannot be dispelled, even by an unbinding."

Spell Duration,104,https://tow.whfb.app/magic/spell-duration,"Rulebook, p. 111","Many spells are cast instantly and their effect is worked out straight away. In such cases, the spell has no further effect until cast again. However, some spells last for longer than this, for one or more phases or turns. For example, some spells expire at the end of the casting player's current turn, whilst other spells last until the start of the next round, expiring at the beginning of the casting player's next Start of Turn sub-phase."
Remains in Play,105,https://tow.whfb.app/magic/remains-in-play,"Rulebook, p. 111","Some spells are marked 'Remains in Play'. Such spells stay in effect indefinitely when cast. They only come to an end when the caster is slain, chooses to end the spell (which they can do at the start of any sub-phase) or leaves the battlefield. The casting Wizard can continue to cast other spells (but not the same Remains in Play spell) as it requires only a little concentration to keep a Remains in Play spell going."
Dispelling Remains in Play Spells,106,https://tow.whfb.app/magic/dispelling-remains-in-play-spells,"Rulebook, p. 111","If not immediately dispelled when cast, you may attempt to dispel a Remains in Play spell cast by your opponent during the Conjuration sub-phase of any of your subsequent turns. To do so, you may attempt either a Fated dispel or a Wizardly dispel (provided the Wizard making the attempt is within Dispel range of the Wizard that cast the spell).Remains in Play spells do not retain the energy of their casting, and so you do not need to beat the original casting result if attempting to dispel in subsequent turns, but rather the minimum casting value given in the spell's description."
Perfect Invocations (Remains In Play),107,https://tow.whfb.app/magic/perfect-invocations-remains-in-play,"Rulebook, p. 111","A Remains in Play spell cast with a perfect invocation cannot be dispelled immediately, but may be dispelled in the Conjuration sub-phase of a subsequent turn, as described above."
Wizards & Armour,108,https://tow.whfb.app/magic/wizards-and-armour,"Rulebook, p. 111","Generally speaking, Wizards dislike armour. Its stifling bulk creates a deadening aura about the Wizard's physical body that blinds their Mage sight and makes it all but impossible for them to manipulate the Winds of Magic.To represent this, a Wizard cannot wear armour or carry a shield. Should a Wizard ever do so, they are unable to make any Casting or Dispel rolls. This penalty applies to all armour and shields, magical or otherwise, but does not include barding (which is worn not by the Wizard, but by their mount).Note, however, that there are some exceptions. Certain special rules, such as 'Chaos Armour' (found in the Warriors of Chaos army list), make a Wizard exempt from this penalty. Similarly, some suits of magical armour are crafted in such a way as to be exempt from this penalty."
The Turn Sequence,109,https://tow.whfb.app/the-turn-sequence,"Rulebook, p. 115","Battle is a chaotic thing. Units of bellowing warriors charge and counter-charge, hacking at the foe with axe, sword and cleaver.

A Game of Rounds & Turns,110,https://tow.whfb.app/the-turn-sequence/a-game-of-rounds-and-turns,"Rulebook, p. 115","A game of Warhammer: the Old World is broken down into a number of 'rounds'. During each round, each player takes one complete 'turn', so that by the end of the game both players will have played the same number of turns. Players alternate taking turns until the battle is over.Whenever a rule refers to a 'turn', it means one player's turn. If a rule encapsulates both player's turns, it will specifically state 'round'."
First Turn (Turn Sequence),111,https://tow.whfb.app/the-turn-sequence/first-turn-turn-sequence,"Rulebook, p. 115","Which player takes the first turn of the game will be determined by the scenario being played. Usually, this is decided by rolling off, although it can be decided in other ways."
Game Length (The Turn Sequence),112,https://tow.whfb.app/the-turn-sequence/game-length-the-turn-sequence,"Rulebook, p. 115","Most games last for six rounds, but sometimes a game can last for seven rounds or be over in only five. In some scenarios, the game length varies."
Active & Inactive Player,113,https://tow.whfb.app/the-turn-sequence/active-and-inactive-player,"Rulebook, p. 115","A game of Warhammer: the Old World consists of a number of rounds. During each of which, each player takes a turn. During your turn, you are referred to as the 'active' player and your opponent is referred to as the 'inactive' player."
The Turn Sequence,114,https://tow.whfb.app/the-turn-sequence/the-turn-sequence,"Rulebook, p. 116","Each player's turn is split into four 'phases', each consisting of four steps referred to as 'sub-phases'. These sub-phases are explained in greater detail in the following sections:The Strategy PhaseDuring the Strategy phase, the active player attempts to cast Enchantment or Hex spells and makes use of certain special rules, before attempting to rally any fleeing units.The Movement PhaseThe Movement phase starts with the declaration of charges and of charge reactions, then the movement of charging units. After this comes compulsory movement. Finally, any remaining movement is carried out and Conveyance spells are cast.The Shooting PhaseDuring the Shooting phase, the active player shoots with those units in their army armed with missile weapons, with their war machines, and attempts to cast Magic Missile and Magical Vortex spells.The Combat PhaseDuring this phase, units fight in deadly hand-to-hand melee and Wizards attempt to fend off their attackers with Assailment spells. Units that have lost combat may be driven back or become broken and flee. At the end of this phase, once all combats have been resolved, the active player's turn ends."
The Strategy Phase,115,https://tow.whfb.app/the-strategy-phase,"Rulebook, p. 116","During the Strategy phase, the active player begins to enact their plans for the turn ahead. Key to this is Wizards channelling and manipulating the Winds of Magic and commanders rallying their forces through strict orders or inspiring words."
The Strategy Phase Sequence,116,https://tow.whfb.app/the-strategy-phase/the-strategy-phase-sequence,"Rulebook, p. 116","Work your way through the sub-phases shown in the summary below. The units in your army can generally act in the order you choose within each sub-phase, providing that you complete one sub-phase before moving onto the next.Start Of TurnThe rules will often call upon a player to make certain tests or perform specific actions at the start of a turn. These things are done now.CommandSome characters have special rules that may represent bold heroes seeking to inspire their comrades, or fabulous abilities granted by magic items. These special rules are used now.ConjurationMany Wizards use their magic to aid their allies in battle. Others use it to inflict terrible curses upon their enemies. Known respectively as Enchantment and Hex spells, these spells are cast now.Rally Fleeing TroopsAs warriors fall, many units turn tail and flee. During this sub-phase, you have a chance to rally any fleeing units. Those that are successful will return to the fray. Those that are not will continue to flee."
Start of Turn,117,https://tow.whfb.app/the-strategy-phase/start-of-turn,"Rulebook, p. 116","Some units will have special actions they have to perform or tests they have to make at the start of the turn. Such rules are not common, and their details will be clearly stated in the model's rules. Such actions are performed and tests made during this sub-phase, in an order chosen by the active player.Sometimes, a scenario may require you to make a test at the start of each turn, or pause to determine if a victory condition has been achieved before playing on. These things are also done now, before the turn begins in earnest.This sub-phase should also be used as a moment in which to think between turns, during which you can remove stray casualties, errant dice and other bits of gaming detritus that have accumulated. Often, players will have questions to ask their opponent, such as how a special rule works or what a magic item does. This is the perfect time to ask such questions, and an opponent should never begrudge giving answers during this natural pause in the action."
Command,118,https://tow.whfb.app/the-strategy-phase/command,"Rulebook, p. 117","During this sub-phase, powerful abilities, both magical and mundane, are unleashed in the form of special rules.The active player chooses one of their models (usually a character) that is not fleeing and that has one or more special rules that can be used during the Command sub-phase. The player states which special rule (if any) they intend to use and, if necessary, which unit(s) will be affected, before making any tests required. The active player then repeats the process for all models in their army that have any special rules that can be used during the Command sub-phase.Note that, unless stated otherwise, a model can only use a special rule once per Command sub-phase."
Conjuration,119,https://tow.whfb.app/the-strategy-phase/conjuration,"Rulebook, p. 117","Many Wizards are able to cast Enchantment spells to the benefit of friendly units. Other Wizards are able to cast Hex spells, hindering the enemy in some way.The active player chooses one of their Wizards that is not fleeing. If that Wizard knows any Enchantment or Hex spells, the player may attempt to cast them now. If the spell is cast successfully, the inactive player may then make a dispel attempt. The active player then chooses another Wizard, repeating the process for all of the Wizards in their army."
Rally Fleeing Units,120,https://tow.whfb.app/the-strategy-phase/rally-fleeing-units,"Rulebook, p. 117","During this sub-phase, the active player must attempt to rally any of their units that are fleeing by making a 'Rally' test for each such unit. To make a Rally test, choose a fleeing unit and test against its Leadership characteristic:If this test is failed, the unit has been unable to rally and it continues fleeing.If this test is passed, the unit has successfully rallied. Then, the active player chooses another fleeing unit, repeating the process until all fleeing units have had a chance to rally."
Rallied Units,121,https://tow.whfb.app/the-strategy-phase/rallied-units,"Rulebook, p. 117","A unit that passes a Rally test regains its composure and returns to the fight. Upon rallying, a unit may immediately perform a free reform. The unit cannot charge during this turn and counts as having moved for the purposes of shooting, but can otherwise act as normal."
Insurmountable Losses,122,https://tow.whfb.app/the-strategy-phase/insurmountable-losses,"Rulebook, p. 117","If a unit has suffered a large number of losses, the remaining models may lack the intestinal fortitude required to return to the fray:Any unit that has been reduced below half (50%) of its starting number of models suffers a -1 modifier to its Leadership when attempting to rally.Any unit that has been reduced below a quarter (25%) of its starting number of models can only pass its Rally test on a roll of a natural double 1."
Fleeing Units (Strategy),123,https://tow.whfb.app/the-strategy-phase/fleeing-units-strategy,"Rulebook, p. 117",Units that fail to rally will continue to flee during the Movement phase.
The Movement Phase,124,https://tow.whfb.app/the-movement-phase,"Rulebook, p. 118","Mastery of the Movement phase is vital to victory on the battlefield. It is in this phase that you will attempt to outmanoeuvre your foe, by moving archers into positions from which to dominate the battlefield, advancing cavalry along a flank to exploit enemy weaknesses and positioning regiments to intimidate the enemy before charging boldly into combat when the time is right.As movement is such a vital part of the game, this section is broken down into two parts. The first gives an overview of the Movement phase itself. The second explains movement in greater detail. As always, if you are not yet familiar with the game, be prepared to spend some time checking other sections of the rules as you read through this section."
The Movement Phase Sequence,125,https://tow.whfb.app/the-movement-phase/the-movement-phase-sequence,"Rulebook, p. 118","As with other phases of the game, the Movement phase is broken down into four sub-phases. Work your way through these in the order shown below. The units in your army can act in whatever order you wish within each sub-phase, providing that you complete one sub-phase before moving onto the next.As movement is such a vital part of the game, this section is broken down into two parts. The first gives an overview of the Movement phase itself. The second explains movement in greater detail. As always, if you are not yet familiar with the game, be prepared to spend some time checking other sections of the rules as you read through this section.Declare Charges & Charge ReactionsThe active player declares which of their units will charge, nominating one unit at a time and indicating which enemy unit it will charge. Once all charges have been declared, the inactive player declares and resolves each charged unit's charge reaction.Charge MovesOnce all charges have been declared and all charge reactions have been resolved, the active player moves their charging units in an order of their choosing.Compulsory MovesSometimes, a player has no choice over whether or not to move a unit; for example, a fleeing unit is obliged to make a flee move. All compulsory moves are made during this sub-phase.Remaining MovesDuring this sub-phase, the active player advances their battle line, moving those units that did not move during the Charge Moves or Compulsory Moves sub-phases."
"The 1"" Rule",126,https://tow.whfb.app/the-movement-phase/the-1-rule,"Rulebook, p. 118","There is one rule of movement that applies throughout the game – the 1"" rule. Quite simply, with the exception of units engaged in combat, no unit can end its movement within 1"" of an enemy unit.Often, a unit will have to move within 1"" of another unit during its move. This is perfectly acceptable, provided that, at the end of the movement, there is 1"" between it and any enemy units. At times, once movement is complete, players may have to nudge units further apart, by the smallest amount possible, to maintain this rule, and this is also perfectly acceptable. Both players should agree upon how best to do this and ensure neither gain any unfair advantage."
Declare Charges & Charge Reactions,127,https://tow.whfb.app/the-movement-phase/declare-charges-and-charge-reactions,"Rulebook, p. 119","At the start of your Movement phase, the first thing you must do is declare which units (if any) will charge. Units are not normally obliged to charge unless a special rule states otherwise.Charging is the only way for a unit to move itself into combat with the foe. If you want to engage an enemy in combat then you must charge them – you cannot simply move into combat without having first declared a charge.To declare a charge you must indicate which of your units is charging, and which enemy unit it is going to charge. A charged unit is often referred to as the 'charge target'. When you declare a charge, one or more of the models in your unit must be able to draw a line of sight to the charge target, and the charge target must lie at least partially within the charging unit's front arc.You are always allowed to measure the distance between your unit and the potential charge target before declaring the charge, and should take into account any terrain that might slow the unit down, as this might well affect your decision whether or not to declare a charge.Charge movement is explained in The Charge Move section."
Who Can Charge?,128,https://tow.whfb.app/the-movement-phase/who-can-charge,"Rulebook, p. 119","Not all units can charge. Units that are already engaged in combat, that are fleeing, or that rallied during the Strategy phase of this turn cannot declare a charge or make a charge move. Units that are in Marching Column can declare a charge, but cannot make a charge move. In rarer cases, units may be prevented from either declaring a charge, or making a charge move, by a special rule or spell effect.Additionally, a unit cannot declare an impossible charge – i.e., one that it cannot possibly complete, either because the enemy unit lies beyond the chargers' maximum possible charge range, or because intervening obstructions make it impossible for the unit to make a charge move that allows it to move into contact.Note that if such an obstruction is another unit, and there is a chance that the intervening unit will move out of the chargers' way before the charge is completed, the charge is 'possible', and therefore can be declared (remember that you still need to see the target to declare the charge though)."
Charging More than One Unit,129,https://tow.whfb.app/the-movement-phase/charging-more-than-one-unit,"Rulebook, p. 119","Normally, a unit can only declare a charge against a single enemy unit. However, should a unit be unable to charge its intended target without making contact with one or more other enemy units, a charge must also be declared against each of those units. In such cases, each charged unit is considered to be a charge target and each must declare and resolve its own charge reaction (in an order chosen by their controlling player)."
Charge Reactions,130,https://tow.whfb.app/the-movement-phase/charge-reactions,"Rulebook, p. 120","Once the active player has declared all of their charges, the inactive player declares a 'charge reaction' for each of the charge targets. There are three charge reactions available to the inactive player: Hold, Stand & Shoot and Flee."
Hold,131,https://tow.whfb.app/the-movement-phase/hold,"Rulebook, p. 120",The unit opts to stand its ground and receive the charge. This is the usual response for units that do not have missile weapons or those units that favour their chances in the fight ahead.Fleeing units cannot Hold. Units already engaged in combat when charged must Hold. Any unit that forgets to declare a charge reaction will Hold.
Stand & Shoot,132,https://tow.whfb.app/the-movement-phase/stand-and-shoot,"Rulebook, p. 120","If a unit is armed with missile weapons and can draw a line of sight to the charging unit, it may declare that it will attempt to Stand & Shoot. Measure the distance between the two units. If the distance is less than the Movement characteristic of the charging unit, the charged unit is unable to raise its weapons in time and must either Hold or Flee instead.Otherwise, even if the distance between the two units is greater than the maximum range of the charged unit's weapons, the charged unit will shoot at the charging unit. Once this shooting has been resolved, the charged unit will Hold and await the charging unit. Charging units are not required to make Panic tests.Fleeing units and units already engaged in combat when charged cannot Stand & Shoot."
Flee (Charge Reaction),133,https://tow.whfb.app/the-movement-phase/flee-charge-reaction,"Rulebook, p. 120","Any unit that is not already engaged in combat may Flee as a charge reaction. Units already fleeing must Flee when charged.When a unit chooses to Flee from a charge, it flees directly away from the charging unit:Pivot the unit about its centre so that it is facing directly away from the centre of the charging enemy unit.After pivoting, the unit makes an immediate flee move.Should a fleeing unit not run far enough, it may be run down and destroyed by the charging unit."
Charge Reactions & Multiple Charging Units,134,https://tow.whfb.app/the-movement-phase/charge-reactions-and-multiple-charging-units,"Rulebook, p. 120","A unit can only Stand & Shoot in response to one charge per turn, even if charged by multiple units. Once all charges have been declared, the inactive player can choose which charging unit to Stand & Shoot at. The unit will then Hold against the other charging units.If a unit charged by multiple enemy units chooses to Flee, it will flee directly away from the enemy unit with the highest Unit Strength. If two enemy units have the same Unit Strength, randomly determine which the unit flees directly away from.Note that, in its haste to flee from one charging enemy unit, a unit might flee through another enemy unit."
Charge Moves,135,https://tow.whfb.app/the-movement-phase/charge-moves,"Rulebook, p. 121","With charge reactions declared and resolved, it is time to see whether or not the charges are successful. Work through charges one at a time, in an order decided by the active player, completing each before moving on to the next."
Determine Charge Range,136,https://tow.whfb.app/the-movement-phase/determine-charge-range,"Rulebook, p. 121","How far a unit can charge is based on its Movement characteristic. However, because a charge represents warriors rushing forward at speed, units can charge further than their basic Movement characteristic.To represent this, as well as the caprices of fate, a unit's 'charge range' is determined by first making a 'Charge' roll. To make a Charge roll, roll two D6 and discard the lowest result. The highest result is the result of the Charge roll. If both dice roll the same result, discard either. The result of the Charge roll is then added to the unit's Movement characteristic to give the unit's charge range.With its charge range established, the charging unit makes its charge move. If the charging unit has insufficient movement to complete its charge move, it is unable to reach the enemy and instead makes a failed charge (see Fig 121.1).Fig 121.1 - Unit A has declared a charge against unit B. Unit A's Movement characteristic is 4"" and a Charge roll of 1 and 5 has been made, for a total charge range of 9"". Alas, unit B is 10"" away, so the charge has failed. Unit A must now move 5"" (the highest result of the two dice rolled)."
The Charge Move (Intro),137,https://tow.whfb.app/the-movement-phase/the-charge-move-intro,"Rulebook, p. 121","Moving a charging unit is often a complicated procedure. For this reason, the charge move itself is covered in greater detail elsewhere, after the basics of movement and manoeuvre have been explained."
Maximum Possible Charge Range,138,https://tow.whfb.app/the-movement-phase/maximum-possible-charge-range,"Rulebook, p. 121",A unit's maximum possible charge range is determined by adding six (the highest possible result of an unmodified Charge roll) to its current Movement characteristic (taking into account any modifiers that might apply to its Movement characteristic).
Failed Charge,139,https://tow.whfb.app/the-movement-phase/failed-charge,"Rulebook, p. 121","A unit that makes a failed charge has started towards the enemy, but is unable to cover the distance. The warriors in the unit simply lose impetus. If a unit makes a failed charge it moves directly towards the target a distance equal to the result of the Charge roll, wheeling as required.Fig 121.1 - Unit A has declared a charge against unit B. Unit A's Movement characteristic is 4"" and a Charge roll of 1 and 5 has been made, for a total charge range of 9"". Alas, unit B is 10"" away, so the charge has failed. Unit A must now move 5"" (the highest result of the two dice rolled)."
Compulsory Moves,140,https://tow.whfb.app/the-movement-phase/compulsory-moves,"Rulebook, p. 122","Generally speaking, a player can move their units however they wish within the confines of the rules. However, sometimes units behave of their own accord. All compulsory movement is carried out in this sub-phase, after charges have been resolved, but before other movement takes place."
Fleeing Units (Movement),141,https://tow.whfb.app/the-movement-phase/fleeing-units-movement,"Rulebook, p. 122","Units that failed to Rally during the Strategy phase will continue to flee during the Compulsory Moves sub-phase. Fleeing units must be moved at the beginning of this subphase, before moving any other units that are obliged to make a compulsory move.Moving a fleeing unit is often a complicated procedure. For this reason, fleeing itself is covered in greater detail after the basics of movement and manoeuvre have been explained in more detail."
Other Types of Compulsory Movement,142,https://tow.whfb.app/the-movement-phase/other-types-of-compulsory-movement,"Rulebook, p. 122","Other units that must move in the Compulsory Moves sub-phase follow the normal movement rules, unless stated otherwise. Any special rules that apply to units that have a compulsory move will be described within their rules. For example, some units have a random Movement characteristic. In other cases, a unit might be obliged to move in a specific direction, or even in a random direction.Whatever the case, any compulsory moves are resolved now, after all fleeing units have moved. These compulsory moves can be resolved in any order the controlling player wishes."
Remaining Moves,143,https://tow.whfb.app/the-movement-phase/remaining-moves,"Rulebook, p. 122","With all charges and compulsory moves attended to, you can now move the rest of your army. While it might lack the drama of charging or the jeopardy of compulsory moves, the Remaining Moves sub-phase is no less important.During this sub-phase players manoeuvre their remaining units in order to set up charges for future turns, as well as attempt to deny future charges their opponent will wish to make. This is also the time to manoeuvre missile troops and Wizards so that they have suitable targets, seize important areas of the battlefield, and so on. Finally, Conveyance spells can be cast at any point during this sub-phase.Note that units which are fleeing, that charged this turn or that moved during the Compulsory Moves sub-phase cannot move again during this sub-phase. Their movement for the turn has already been completed."
Movement in Detail,144,https://tow.whfb.app/movement-in-detail,"Rulebook, p. 123","Moving an army is an important and often decisive part of the game. When opposing commanders are well matched, move and counter move can become complex and challenging as the rival armies search for an advantage.This section begins with the rules for basic movement and manoeuvre, before delving into the intricacies of charging and fleeing. Finally, you will find an explanation of how different types of battlefield terrain can hinder, or even halt, movement."
Basic Movement,145,https://tow.whfb.app/movement-in-detail/basic-movement,"Rulebook, p. 123","The most basic move any model or unit can make is to move forward a number of inches up to its Movement characteristic, as shown in Fig 123.1. If there is more than one Movement characteristic within a unit, the entire unit moves at the rate of the slowest model.Units arrayed in rank and file are cumbersome, and find it hard to change direction. Models (and units) must move forward in a straight line, unless performing a manoeuvre.Fig 123.1 - The distance a model moves is measured from the front of its base. The model is then moved and the front of its base placed in line with the end of the tape measure."
Marching,146,https://tow.whfb.app/movement-in-detail/marching,"Rulebook, p. 123","Most units are able to 'march', allowing them to move rapidly across the battlefield. A marching unit can double its Movement characteristic. Whilst marching a unit can wheel to change direction, but cannot perform any other manoeuvres. However, a unit that marched in the Movement phase cannot shoot during the Shooting phase (including casting Magic Missile or Magical Vortex spells).Note that whilst in Marching Column, a Close Order formation may triple its Movement characteristic when Marching."
Enemy Sighted,147,https://tow.whfb.app/movement-in-detail/enemy-sighted,"Rulebook, p. 123","Units are often unwilling to march when the enemy is close. If you wish a unit to begin a march move whilst within 8"" of an enemy unit (ignoring enemy units that are fleeing), it must first make a Leadership test. If this test is failed, the unit refuses to march but may move normally. If this test is passed, the unit may march.Note that if a unit attempts an Enemy Sighted test in order to march and fails, it is considered to have marched, even if its controlling player then elects to not move the unit at all."
Manoeuvres,148,https://tow.whfb.app/movement-in-detail/manoeuvres,"Rulebook, p. 124","There are six types of manoeuvre to choose from: wheel, turn, move backwards, move sideways, redress the ranks and reform. During its movement, a unit may perform a single manoeuvre. Regardless of the manoeuvre performed, no model can move more than twice its Movement characteristic.WheelTurnMove BackwardsMove SidewaysRedress The RanksReform"
Wheel,149,https://tow.whfb.app/movement-in-detail/wheel,"Rulebook, p. 124","'Wheeling' is the best way of making an alteration to the direction a unit is facing whilst still being able to advance. To wheel, the leading edge of the unit moves forward, pivoting round one of its front corners, as shown in Fig 124.1.When a unit wheels, every model counts as having moved as far as the outside model. Once the wheel is complete, you may use any movement the unit has remaining. Unless it is charging, a unit can wheel more than once during its move and can alternate between moving forward and wheeling.Fig 124.1"
Turn,150,https://tow.whfb.app/movement-in-detail/turn,"Rulebook, p. 124","To execute a turn, all the models remain in place but are turned through 90° or 180° to face their side or rear. For every 90° it turns, a unit uses a quarter of its Movement characteristic.When a unit turns, all models in complete ranks simply turn on the spot. Any models in an incomplete rear rank are moved to the rear of the new formation.When a unit is turned to face its side or rear, any Command models it contains are automatically placed into the new front rank. If there is not enough space in the front rank, such models are placed in the second rank.Fig 124.2Fig 124.3Fig 124.4 - From its initial position in Fig 124.2, the unit may spend a quarter of its movement to turn 90°, as shown in Fig 124.3, or half of its movement to turn 180°, as shown in Fig 124.4."
Move Backwards,151,https://tow.whfb.app/movement-in-detail/move-backwards,"Rulebook, p. 125","Units can move backwards as well as forward, but tend to shuffle carefully rather than stride purposefully. To represent this, a unit that moves backwards must halve its Movement characteristic."
Move Sideways,152,https://tow.whfb.app/movement-in-detail/move-sideways,"Rulebook, p. 125","Units can move sideways as well as forward, but do so with caution in order to maintain their formation. To represent this, a unit that moves sideways must halve its Movement characteristic."
Redress the Ranks,153,https://tow.whfb.app/movement-in-detail/redress-the-ranks,"Rulebook, p. 125","Units can redress the ranks by moving models to or from their rear ranks to decrease or increase the number of models in their front rank. A unit may use half of its Movement characteristic in order to deduct up to five models from its front rank (as shown in Fig 125.1), or to add up to five models to its front rank (as shown in Fig 125.2).The models in the remaining ranks are then rearranged to match the number of models in the front rank and maintain a correct formation. Remember, there must be the same number of models in each rank. Only the rear rank may have fewer models.Fig 125.1 - This unit uses half of its movement to reduce its frontage by five models. As a result it goes from ten wide to five wide, gaining an extra rank.Fig 125.2 - This unit uses half of its movement to increase its frontage by five models. As a result it goes from five wide to ten wide."
Reform,154,https://tow.whfb.app/movement-in-detail/reform,"Rulebook, p. 125","A reform represents the most complex of manoeuvres a unit can perform on the battlefield, but on the tabletop it is quite straightforward. Reforming allows a unit to sacrifice its entire movement in order to both pivot about its centre to change its facing by up to 180°, and to rearrange its ranks and files as required to either change its formation, or to adopt a different formation."
Pivoting,155,https://tow.whfb.app/movement-in-detail/pivoting,"Rulebook, p. 125","Sometimes, the rules will require a unit to 'pivot,' usually about its centre. This is exactly as it sounds. The unit is not performing any of the manoeuvres previously described – instead it spins on the spot, using its centre as a pivot point, ignoring the presence of other units or terrain whilst it does so."
The Ends of the World,156,https://tow.whfb.app/movement-in-detail/the-ends-of-the-world,"Rulebook, p. 125","It is important to note that the edge of the battlefield does not represent the end of the world. It is perfectly acceptable for a corner of a unit to cross beyond the edge of the battlefield during a manoeuvre, provided the unit is able to end its movement completely upon the battlefield."
The Charge Move,157,https://tow.whfb.app/movement-in-detail/the-charge-move,"Rulebook, p. 126","As mentioned previously, moving a charging unit can often be quite complex. This is because a charging unit is obliged to fulfil certain criteria:A charging unit must endeavour to bring as many models as possible within its front rank into base contact with models in the charged unit.A charging unit must move by the shortest route possible to reach its charge target.A charging unit must move forward in as straight a line as possible.After moving, a unit that charged must ensure that it is aligned against the charge target."
Manoeuvring During a Charge,158,https://tow.whfb.app/movement-in-detail/manoeuvring-during-a-charge,"Rulebook, p. 126","Unless stated otherwise, a charging unit cannot perform a turn, move backwards, move sideways, redress the ranks or reform manoeuvre during its charge move.However, a charging unit must endeavour to bring the maximum number of models from both sides into base contact, which will often require some degree of manoeuvre. To facilitate this, a charging unit may wheel once, at any point, during its move, as shown in Fig 126.2.Note that a charging unit does not have to complete its wheel if doing so would cause it to make a failed charge or would prevent the completion of a charge declared by another unit.Once a charging unit has completed any required wheel, it completes its movement, moving straight ahead towards the charge target and stops as soon as the two units touch.Fig 162.1 - 1. Declare Charge.Fig 162.2 - 2. Wheel to maximise contact."
Aligning to the Enemy,159,https://tow.whfb.app/movement-in-detail/aligning-to-the-enemy,"Rulebook, p. 126","Usually, moving a charging unit in the manner described will leave it and the charged unit in base contact at a peculiar angle with an odd gap in between. In a real battle warriors would quickly move to attack their enemies and, in so doing, close the gap – which is exactly what happens in the game.Once the charging unit contacts the charge target, it must perform a second, free wheel (if required) to bring its front facing into flush contact with the facing of the enemy unit that has been charged, as shown in Fig 126.4.Fig 162.3 - 3. Move in.Fig 162.4 - 4. Align to the enemy."
Flank & Rear Charges,160,https://tow.whfb.app/movement-in-detail/flank-and-rear-charges,"Rulebook, p. 127","Sometimes, your unit will be able to charge into the flank or rear of an enemy unit. This is particularly beneficial because an attack from an unexpected direction gives you an advantage in combat.A charging unit's position when the charge is declared determines whether it charges into the front, flank or rear of the enemy unit. A unit's position in relation to its potential charge target is determined when the charge is declared.If the charging unit is in the charge target's front arc when the charge is declared, it charges into that unit's front. As units generally begin the game facing each other, this is the most common situation that will arise.However, if the charging unit is within a flank arc of its charge target when the charge is declared, it charges into that unit's flank. If the charging unit is within the rear arc of its charge target when the charge is declared, it charges into that unit's rear.Fig 127.1 - Unit A has been charged by units B and C. Unit B is completely within unit A's front arc. Unit C, however, straddles unit A's flank and rear arc. Three of the models in unit C's front rank are in the flank arc, whilst only two models are in the rear arc. Unit C is therefore considered to be in unit A's flank and will charge accordingly."
Resolving Uncertainties,161,https://tow.whfb.app/movement-in-detail/resolving-uncertainties,"Rulebook, p. 127","Sometimes, a charging unit will straddle two arcs. In such cases, count how many models in the front rank of the charging unit lie within each arc. If there are more models in one arc, the unit is considered to be in that arc.If it is still unclear, the charging unit is considered to be in the arc that gives it the least advantage in terms of combat result. For example, if you cannot determine whether a charging unit is in the flank or rear arc, it is in the flank arc."
Unusual Situations (Charging),162,https://tow.whfb.app/movement-in-detail/unusual-situations-charging,"Rulebook, p. 128","Unusual situations can arise as units charge. The following sections attempt to deal with these. However, should a situation ever arise that cannot easily be resolved, players should agree with one another upon the most logical course of action, and avoid getting bogged down in overly long debates."
Unable to Align,163,https://tow.whfb.app/movement-in-detail/unable-to-align,"Rulebook, p. 128","On occasion, a charging unit will be able to make contact with its charge target, but unable to align to it because something lies in the way. In such cases, the charge target should align itself against the charging unit. If this is not possible, simply leave a gap. In either case, the charging unit has made a disordered charge, as shown in Fig 128.1 and Fig 128.2:Fig 128.1 - Unit A charges unit B. It wheels to bring as many models into base contact as possible, and to avoid the terrain before moving in.Fig 128.2 - After making contact, unit A cannot align to unit B – the terrain is in the way. Unit B then wheels to align. Not being as wide as unit A, it moves past the terrain and the gap is closed."
Disordered Charge,164,https://tow.whfb.app/movement-in-detail/disordered-charge,"Rulebook, p. 128",A unit that has made a disordered charge does not gain the Initiative modifier for charging.
Charging Through Terrain,165,https://tow.whfb.app/movement-in-detail/charging-through-terrain,"Rulebook, p. 128","A charging unit must move by the shortest route possible to reach its charge target. Therefore, charging units will often be obliged to move through difficult or dangerous terrain, or across low linear obstacles. This is perfectly acceptable, but a charge made through any form of terrain is more difficult, and often much slower, than a charge made across open ground.Before making a charging unit's Charge roll, check to see if any part of the unit will move through difficult or dangerous terrain, or across a low linear obstacle, when it makes its charge move. If so, that unit must discard the highest result when making its Charge roll, rather than the lowest, and will suffer a -1 modifier to its Movement characteristic (to a minimum of 1) when making its charge move.Finally, if a unit ends its charge move with a quarter (25%) or more of its models within difficult terrain, or straddling a low linear obstacle, it becomes Disrupted and cannot claim a Rank Bonus."
Charging a Fleeing Enemy,166,https://tow.whfb.app/movement-in-detail/charging-a-fleeing-enemy,"Rulebook, p. 129","When a charged unit turns tail and flees, the charging unit has two options: attempt to run down an enemy that flees from it, or attempt to redirect its charge."
Running Down the Foe,167,https://tow.whfb.app/movement-in-detail/running-down-the-foe,"Rulebook, p. 129","Once the charge target has completed its flee move, the charging unit makes its charge move as normal. If the charging unit makes contact with the fleeing unit, it will wheel to align as normal. Caught by the enemy, the fleeing unit is hacked to pieces and immediately removed from play.The charging unit may then attempt to reform by making a Leadership test. If this test is failed, the unit is unable to reform. If this test is passed, the unit may make a free reform. In either case, the unit cannot move again this turn.If the charging unit does not make contact with the fleeing unit, it moves forward its full charge range. It has not made a failed charge – the charge target ran away."
Redirecting a Charge,168,https://tow.whfb.app/movement-in-detail/redirecting-a-charge,"Rulebook, p. 129","Once the charge target has completed its flee move, the charging unit may attempt to redirect its charge if there is an eligible alternative charge target, as shown in Fig 129.1. This can be:A unit which the charging unit could have declared a charge against at the beginning of this phase.A unit that has been revealed by the movement of the fleeing unit.If the charging unit wishes to redirect, it must first make a Leadership test. If this test is failed, the unit must attempt to run down the fleeing unit. If this test is passed, the unit may redirect, immediately declaring a charge against its new target.The target of a redirected charge does not have time to Stand & Shoot, the only charge reactions available to it are Hold and Flee. Should it Flee, the charge cannot be redirected again.When a charge is redirected, the original charge target is not run down and will flee to safety. A charge cannot be redirected if there are no eligible alternative charge targets.Fig 129.1 - Unit A declared a charge against unit B, which chose to Flee, and fled 3"". Once unit B has completed its flee move, unit A attempts to redirect its charge against unit C. To do so, it must make a Leadership test. Unit A passes this test with ease, and is free to redirect its charge against unit C."
Multiple Charging Units,169,https://tow.whfb.app/movement-in-detail/multiple-charging-units,"Rulebook, p. 130","When two or more units are charging into the same arc of a single enemy unit, they are considered to move simultaneously and both units must try to bring the maximum number of models from both sides into base contact.Fig 130.1 - Units A and B have both declared a charge against unit C. They use their movement to ensure that the maximum number of models from each unit make base contact with models in unit C."
Multiple Charge Targets,170,https://tow.whfb.app/movement-in-detail/multiple-charge-targets,"Rulebook, p. 130","A unit may be unable to charge its intended target without making contact with other enemy units. In such cases, the charging unit must declare a charge against all of the enemy units it will contact, and each is able to declare its own charge reaction.If the charging unit is unable to align itself to all of the enemy units once contact has been made, those enemy units the charging unit cannot align against must themselves align against it. The charging unit counts as having made a disordered charge against any unit that was obliged to align against it.Fig 130.2 - Unit A wishes to charge unit C. However, due to the width of unit A, it cannot do so without contacting both units B and D as well. Unit A therefore declares a charge against all three and all three declare their charge reactions.Fig 130.3 - Once unit A has moved, it is unable to align against units B and D. Therefore, units B and D must align to unit A. Unit A is considered to have made a disordered charge against units B and D (but not against unit C)."
Accidental Contact,171,https://tow.whfb.app/movement-in-detail/accidental-contact,"Rulebook, p. 131","Sometimes, particularly during the push and pull of combat, units make accidental contact with enemy units. Should this prove unavoidable, there are several ways to resolve this.If a unit is contacted in its front arc, and if it is not itself already engaged in combat, the unit may either:Commit to combat, aligning against the enemy unit that made accidental contact with it (neither unit counts as having charged and both fight in Initiative order).Give Ground to avoid being drawn into an unwanted combat.However, if a unit is accidentally contacted in its flank or rear arc, or is itself already engaged in combat, its owning player must move it (and, if necessary, any units it is in combat with) aside by the minimum amount necessary to ensure it is both 1"" away from the unit that accidentally contacted it and still engaged in its own combat."
Accidental Contact When Running Down the Foe,172,https://tow.whfb.app/movement-in-detail/accidental-contact-when-running-down-the-foe,"Rulebook, p. 131","A charging unit that has chosen to run down a fleeing charge target may make accidental contact with another enemy unit. When this happens, the charging unit is considered to have redirected its charge against that unit and the fleeing unit escapes.If the charging unit makes accidental contact with two or more enemy units, treat it as you would a unit charging multiple charge targets, as described previously."
Accidental Contact During a Charge,173,https://tow.whfb.app/movement-in-detail/accidental-contact-during-a-charge,"Rulebook, p. 131","A charging unit might find its path unexpectedly blocked by another enemy unit, usually one that has fled from another charge. If the charging unit is able to wheel to avoid the unit and complete its charge, it should. If this is not possible, or if doing so will cause a failed charge, the charging unit has two options – it can halt its charge, or it can continue ahead."
Halting a Charge,174,https://tow.whfb.app/movement-in-detail/halting-a-charge,"Rulebook, p. 131","If the charging unit wishes to halt its charge, it is moved towards its charge target as normal, stopping 1"" away from the unit that has blocked its path. A halted charge is not a failed charge."
Continuing Ahead,175,https://tow.whfb.app/movement-in-detail/continuing-ahead,"Rulebook, p. 131","If the charging unit chooses to continue ahead, the outcome will depend upon the enemy unit:If a charging unit makes accidental contact with a fleeing enemy unit, it will wheel to align as normal. The fleeing unit is considered to have been run down by the charging unit and is immediately removed from play. The charging unit's movement comes to an end and, due to the confused circumstances, cannot attempt to reform.If a charging unit makes accidental contact with an enemy unit that is not fleeing, simply treat the charging unit as having redirected its charge into that unit."
Flee!,176,https://tow.whfb.app/movement-in-detail/flee,"Rulebook, p. 132","Units flee for many reasons. Units that fail to rally during the Strategy phase will flee in the Compulsory Moves sub-phase, others will flee from a charging enemy, and so forth.

Direction of Flight,177,https://tow.whfb.app/movement-in-detail/direction-of-flight,"Rulebook, p. 132","When a unit flees, the direction of its flight will be determined by whatever caused it to flee. In most cases, this is an enemy unit. Units that fail to Rally will continue in the direction of their earlier flight, rarely changing direction."
Fleeing from an Enemy Unit,178,https://tow.whfb.app/movement-in-detail/fleeing-from-an-enemy-unit,"Rulebook, p. 132","When the rules call for a unit to flee directly away from an enemy unit, pivot the fleeing unit about its centre so that it is facing directly away from the centre of the enemy unit it is fleeing from, as shown in Fig 132.1. After pivoting, the unit makes an immediate flee move, as shown in Fig 132.2.Fig 132.1 - 1. Unit A is fleeing from unit B. Therefore, unit A pivots around its centre point until facing directly away from unit B.Fig 132.2 - 2. Unit A then moves forward a distance equal to its Flee roll."

The Flee Move,180,https://tow.whfb.app/movement-in-detail/the-flee-move,"Rulebook, p. 132","To determine how far a fleeing unit moves, make a Flee roll after pivoting it (if required). To make a Flee roll, roll 2D6. The result of this roll is the distance in inches that the fleeing unit moves. A fleeing unit:Moves straight ahead in the direction it is facing.Must move the full distance rolled, even if doing so would take the unit off the battlefield.May change direction by pivoting only if required to move around impassable terrain."
Destruction of a Fleeing Unit,181,https://tow.whfb.app/movement-in-detail/destruction-of-a-fleeing-unit,"Rulebook, p. 132","Should any part of a fleeing unit move into contact with, or cross beyond, the edge of the battlefield, the entire unit is removed from play and counts as having been destroyed."
Fleeing Through Friendly Units,182,https://tow.whfb.app/movement-in-detail/fleeing-through-friendly-units,"Rulebook, p. 133","As fleeing units have broken formation, they are able to move through friendly units without stopping or slowing. If the flee move would result in the fleeing unit ending up 'on top' of a friendly unit, then it carries on fleeing straight forward until it is clear of the unit, and will then halt."
Fleeing Through Enemy Units,183,https://tow.whfb.app/movement-in-detail/fleeing-through-enemy-units,"Rulebook, p. 133","Sometimes, a fleeing unit will run through an enemy unit. This is obviously extremely perilous. To represent this, once a fleeing unit's movement is complete, make a 'Peril' test for each model in the unit that moved through an enemy unit, as shown in Fig 133.1. To make a Peril test, roll a D6. On a roll of 4+, the model escapes without incident. On a roll of 1-3, the model is struck by the enemy and loses a single Wound.If the flee move would result in the fleeing unit ending up 'on top' of or within 1"" of an enemy unit, it carries on fleeing straight forward until it is 1"" away from the enemy unit, and will then halt.Note that there is no limit to how many Peril tests a unit may be required to make during a single move.Fig 133.1 - Unit A must flee through an enemy unit, causing eight models to make a Peril test."
Fleeing Through Terrain,184,https://tow.whfb.app/movement-in-detail/fleeing-through-terrain,"Rulebook, p. 133","A fleeing unit moves through difficult and dangerous terrain without suffering any negative modifiers to its Movement characteristic, though it must make any Dangerous Terrain tests required.

The Shooting Phase,205,https://tow.whfb.app/the-shooting-phase,"Rulebook, p. 136","During the Shooting phase, your army lets fly with the missile weapons at its disposal, be they humble bows, fantastical war machines or devastating spells. Most armies will contain a unit or two of archers, a war machine or a Wizard that knows various deadly spells, and will use these to thin the enemy ranks. Other armies will field masses and masses of missile units, intending to seize victory in the Shooting phase by obliterating the enemy at long range.This section covers the shooting rules for common weapons and the majority of troop types, including Wizards able to cast Magic Missiles or Magical Vortex spells. War machines and other, more peculiar, devices of destruction are explained in greater detail in their own section. However, even the most colossal trebuchet is governed by many of the same rules as the humble bow and arrow, so it is worth reading through this section before unlimbering your organ gun."
The Shooting Phase Sequence,206,https://tow.whfb.app/the-shooting-phase/the-shooting-phase-sequence,"Rulebook, p. 136","Just like the other phases of the game, the Shooting phase is broken down into four sub-phases.

Check Range,210,https://tow.whfb.app/the-shooting-phase/check-range,"Rulebook, p. 137","All missile weapons have a maximum range. A model cannot shoot at a target if it lies beyond this maximum range. Often, not every model in a unit will be within range of the target.

Models that are making a Stand & Shoot charge reaction suffer a -1 To Hit modifier. Note that models making a Stand & Shoot charge reaction do not suffer any additional modifiers for Firing at Long Range.
Cover Modifiers,222,https://tow.whfb.app/the-shooting-phase/cover-modifiers,"Rulebook, p. 139",Cover is determined based on how heavily obscured the line of sight between the shooting model and its target is.
Target Behind Partial Cover,223,https://tow.whfb.app/the-shooting-phase/target-behind-partial-cover,"Rulebook, p. 139","If up to half of the target model (if shooting at a lone model) is obscured, or up to half of the models within the target unit (if shooting at a unit) are obscured, by terrain or other models, they are in partial cover.

7+ to Hit,225,https://tow.whfb.app/the-shooting-phase/7-to-hit,"Rulebook, p. 139","Sometimes, the negative modifiers applied to a roll To Hit may result in you needing to roll a 7 or more on a single D6. For example, a model with BS2 normally hits on a roll of 5 or above. But if you apply a -2 modifier to a roll of 5 it becomes a roll of 3. Therefore, you would need to roll a 7 to achieve the target number of 5+, which is not, strictly speaking, possible on a six-sided dice.In such cases, there is still a chance of hitting. Roll To Hit as normal. Each dice that rolls a natural 6 represents that chance of hitting and is rolled again, as shown below:D6 Roll NeededWill Hit On A Natural 6…7followed by a 4+8followed by a 5+9followed by a 610Impossible!To continue the previous example, if a unit of models with BS2 suffered a -2 To Hit modifier, simply roll To Hit as normal. Then, take each dice that rolls a natural 6 and roll it again. Each of these dice that rolls a 4 or more is a hit."

Roll to Wound (Shooting),227,https://tow.whfb.app/the-shooting-phase/roll-to-wound-shooting,"Rulebook, p. 140","To determine how many hits cause wounds, you must make a roll 'To Wound' for each hit.

To represent this, your opponent can make an 'Armour Save' roll for each wound caused by your shooting. To make an Armour Save roll, roll a D6 for the wounded model and compare the result to that model's armour value:If the Armour Save roll equals or exceeds the model's armour value, the model is saved by its armour and the wound discarded.If the result is less than the model's armour value, the model's armour has proved ineffective and the wound is 'unsaved'.Rolls of a Natural 1Even the heaviest and most finely crafted of armour has gaps in it.

Determining Armour Value,230,https://tow.whfb.app/the-shooting-phase/determining-armour-value,"Rulebook, p. 141","A model's armour value is determined by the armour it wears. Armour value is presented as a target number, meaning the lower the value, the better the chance of making a successful Armour Save roll. Light armour, for example, grants an armour value of 6+.A model's armour value can be improved (to a maximum of 2+) by other equipment carried. For example, a shield improves its bearer's armour value by 1, meaning that a model wearing light armour and carrying a shield would have an armour value of 5+.Note that a model that wears no armour should be considered to have an armour value of 7+ for the purposes of Armour Save roll modifiers and any rules that improve armour value."
Armour Piercing,231,https://tow.whfb.app/the-shooting-phase/armour-piercing,"Rulebook, p. 141","A weapon's Armour Piercing (AP) characteristic represents its ability to cut through armour. This is always presented as a negative modifier, which is applied to the Armour Save roll.For example, if the target of an attack made by a weapon with an AP characteristic of -1 has an armour value of 5+, it would need to roll a 6 when making its Armour Save roll. A roll of 5 would give a result of 4 once the modifier is applied."
Ward Saves,232,https://tow.whfb.app/the-shooting-phase/ward-saves,"Rulebook, p. 141","A Ward save represents the magical protection offered by an enchanted talisman or suit of armour. The armour value of a Ward save will always be shown either in the description of the item that grants it, or in a special rule. The key difference between a Ward save and a regular armour save is that a Ward save can never be modified by the AP characteristic of a weapon."
More than One Save,233,https://tow.whfb.app/the-shooting-phase/more-than-one-save,"Rulebook, p. 141","A model that can make both an Armour Save roll and a Ward save makes its Armour Save roll first.

Make Panic Tests,236,https://tow.whfb.app/the-shooting-phase/make-panic-tests,"Rulebook, p. 142","Rarely does shooting alone destroy an army, but it can thin the enemy's numbers considerably, causing regiments to lose their nerve. When they do, they will often fall back and, sometimes, turn tail and flee.If, during a single Shooting phase, a unit loses more than a quarter (25%) of the models it contained at the start of that Shooting phase, it must immediately make a Panic test. To make a Panic test, test against the unit's Leadership characteristic. If this test is failed, the unit has succumbed to panic. If this test is passed, the unit remains resolute and does not panic."
Fall Back or Flee,237,https://tow.whfb.app/the-shooting-phase/fall-back-or-flee,"Rulebook, p. 142","What happens to a unit that fails a Panic test will depend upon how many casualties it has suffered. A unit that has suffered only a few casualties will Fall Back in Good Order, whereas a unit that has suffered a significant amount of casualties will turn tail and flee.Fall Back in Good OrderIf a unit still contains more than half (50%) of the models it contained at the start of the battle, it will Fall Back in Good Order. The unit moves directly away from the enemy unit whose shooting caused it to make the Panic test.FleeIf a unit contains only half (50%), or fewer than half, of the models it contained at the start of the battle, it will immediately turn tail and flee.

No Need for Hysterics (Shooting),238,https://tow.whfb.app/the-shooting-phase/no-need-for-hysterics-shooting,"Rulebook, p. 142","A unit is only required to make a single Panic test during any Shooting phase. For example, if a unit loses more than a quarter of its number to shooting from one enemy unit but passes its Panic test, it will not have to take another Panic test during that same Shooting phase even if it then suffers more casualties from another enemy unit. This is because, whilst shooting is resolved one unit at a time, in reality all units would shoot more or less simultaneously. Therefore, all casualties would fall at roughly the same time."
Oddball Stuff (Shooting),239,https://tow.whfb.app/the-shooting-phase/oddball-stuff-shooting,"Rulebook, p. 143","Despite the detail of the previous sections, there will always be situations in which something is unclear. This is especially true when more advanced rules are introduced."

For example, a unit armed with crossbows can shoot with its first two ranks when standing on a hill.Volley FireSome units are armed with weapons that have the Volley Fire special rule. This special rule allows half of the models in each rank other than the front rank (or front two ranks if the unit is on a hill) to fire over the heads of those in front.In either case, if there is ever any question over how many models can fire, always round up, not down.Note that when shooting with a unit you must determine range for each model individually."
Automatic Hits,243,https://tow.whfb.app/the-shooting-phase/automatic-hits,"Rulebook, p. 143","Some attacks hit automatically, simply causing a number of hits with no roll To Hit required. In such cases, it is exactly as it sounds – do not make a roll To Hit, the attack hits automatically."

The Combat Phase,247,https://tow.whfb.app/the-combat-phase,"Rulebook, p. 144","With the foe outmanoeuvred and weakened by spellcraft and shooting, it is time to finish the job! The Combat phase is when your warriors hack, slice and pummel their way through the enemy ranks. A successful Combat phase can completely change the fortunes of your army and, if you have prepared well in your earlier phases, victory is likely to be your reward.The Combat phase heavily involves both players, although the active player will be the one choosing the order in which each of the combats is fought and resolved. All combats must be resolved during this phase – a unit engaged in combat with the enemy cannot choose not to fight."
The Combat Phase Sequence,248,https://tow.whfb.app/the-combat-phase/the-combat-phase-sequence,"Rulebook, p. 144","As usual, the Combat phase is broken down into four sub-phases. This sequence is followed in full for each combat, one at a time.The active player simply chooses a 'combat' and both players complete all four sub-phases in the order shown below. Once this sequence has been completed for the chosen combat, that 'round' of combat is complete and the active player chooses another combat, repeating the process until all combats have been fought.Choose & Fight CombatThe active player chooses a combat and, starting with the models with the highest Initiative, attacks are made, wounds inflicted and casualties removed. Then, surviving models with lower Initiative repeat this process until all models involved in the combat have fought.Calculate Combat ResultWith the fighting done, work out which side has won the combat and by how much. Unless the combat is a stalemate, one side will have lost by 1, 2 or more 'combat result' points.Break TestEach unit on the losing side of a combat must make a Break test. The outcome of this test determines whether the losing unit Gives Ground, Falls Back in Good Order or turns tail and flees.Follow Up & PursuitUnits on the winning side of a combat can choose to follow up an enemy that Gives Ground, to pursue an enemy that Falls Back in Good Order or breaks, or to restrain from pursuit."
End of Turn,249,https://tow.whfb.app/the-combat-phase/end-of-turn,"Rulebook, p. 144","Once all combats have been resolved, the active player's turn ends.

Choose Combat & Determine Who Can Fight,251,https://tow.whfb.app/the-combat-phase/choose-combat-and-determine-who-can-fight,"Rulebook, p. 145","Any units that are in base contact with one or more enemy units are 'engaged in combat'. Each individual engagement between two or more units is referred to as a 'combat'. The active player chooses one combat to be resolved in full, referred to as fighting a 'round' of combat. This process is repeated until all combats have been fought."
Who Can Fight?,252,https://tow.whfb.app/the-combat-phase/who-can-fight,"Rulebook, p. 145","It is rare that every model in a unit is able to fight. Usually, only models in a fighting rank can fight, whilst the models behind them press forward, ready to take the place of the fallen."
Base Contact,253,https://tow.whfb.app/the-combat-phase/base-contact,"Rulebook, p. 145","Any model that is in base contact with an enemy model can fight, even if the enemy model is in contact with its flank or rear and even if the models' bases only touch at the corner."
The Fighting Rank,254,https://tow.whfb.app/the-combat-phase/the-fighting-rank,"Rulebook, p. 145","When two opposing units are engaged in combat, any row of models (be it a rank or file) that has one or more models in base contact with the enemy is called the 'fighting rank'. Every model within the fighting rank can fight. This represents models in that row but not in base contact with the enemy encircling the foe.Fig 145.1 - Units A and B are engaged in combat. Every model in the front rank of unit A and several models in the front rank of unit B are in base contact with enemy models. Therefore, the front rank of each unit is the 'fighting rank'. Although not every model in the front rank of unit B is in base contact with an enemy model, those that are not would, in reality, encircle the foe (rather than stand by and watch). Therefore, every model that belongs to the fighting rank of unit B can fight."
Supporting Attacks,255,https://tow.whfb.app/the-combat-phase/supporting-attacks,"Rulebook, p. 145","Some models are equipped with weapons that allow them to make a 'supporting attack'.

How Many Attacks?,256,https://tow.whfb.app/the-combat-phase/how-many-attacks,"Rulebook, p. 146","When a model fights in combat, it makes a number of 'attacks'.

Disordered Charges,259,https://tow.whfb.app/the-combat-phase/disordered-charges,"Rulebook, p. 146","In certain situations, a unit's charge may become disordered. A unit that makes a disordered charge does not gain the Initiative modifier for charging."
Simultaneous Combat,260,https://tow.whfb.app/the-combat-phase/simultaneous-combat,"Rulebook, p. 146","If models on both sides of a combat have the same Initiative value (after modifiers), they will attack at the same time.

Slain models are considered to have been removed from the end(s) of the fighting rank. This represents members of the rear ranks 'stepping forward' to fill gaps, whilst models remaining in the fighting rank 'close in' upon the enemy.Note that a model cannot attack during a phase in which it stepped forward into the fighting rank. However, any models that remain in the fighting rank after casualties have been removed are more likely to be in base contact with the enemy, having closed in upon them."
Set Casualties Aside,273,https://tow.whfb.app/the-combat-phase/set-casualties-aside,"Rulebook, p. 150","It is a good idea not to immediately remove casualties from the battlefield during the Combat phase, but to temporarily place them next to their unit. There are two reasons for this:Firstly, when it comes to working out who has won the combat, you will need to know how many Wounds have been inflicted this turn. This can most often be quickly determined by counting the number of models removed as casualties.Secondly, models removed as casualties before having a chance to attack, and models that stepped forward during the current phase, cannot attack. Therefore, the number of casualties inflicted on a unit will often reduce the number of models able to fight back. By placing casualties next to their unit, you can tell at a glance how many models have been removed from the fighting rank."
Excess Casualties,274,https://tow.whfb.app/the-combat-phase/excess-casualties,"Rulebook, p. 150","It can sometimes happen that a unit suffers more casualties than it has models in its fighting rank. Should this happen, casualties are removed as normal, representing casualties caused in the rank (or file) behind the fighting rank.In such cases, and if the unit suffering the casualties is able to make supporting attacks, any excess casualties will reduce the number of supporting attacks."
Fight On!,275,https://tow.whfb.app/the-combat-phase/fight-on,"Rulebook, p. 150","With casualties removed, check to see if there are any models with a lower Initiative still to fight in this combat. If there are, repeat steps 1.2, 1.3 and 1.4 for those models. If there are no models left to fight in this combat, move on to the next sub-phase."
Calculate Combat Result,276,https://tow.whfb.app/the-combat-phase/calculate-combat-result,"Rulebook, p. 151","Once every model engaged in the combat has fought, you must determine which side has won that round of combat.

Unsaved Wounds Inflicted,279,https://tow.whfb.app/the-combat-phase/unsaved-wounds-inflicted,"Rulebook, p. 151","Each side's basic combat result is equal to the number of unsaved wounds it caused during this Combat phase, plus any unsaved wounds a unit caused by shooting if it chose to Stand & Shoot as a charge reaction during this turn. In other words, each Wound the enemy side lost this turn due to a Stand & Shoot charge reaction or during the Combat phase is counted and is worth 1 combat result point.Should an attack or rule cause an enemy model to be removed from play as a casualty, it counts as having lost a number of Wounds equal to the number it had remaining at the time it was removed.Note that it is important to count the number of Wounds lost, rather than the number of casualties, because many models have more than one wound."
Rank Bonus,280,https://tow.whfb.app/the-combat-phase/rank-bonus,"Rulebook, p. 151","Depending upon its formation, and if it is wide enough, a unit can claim a Rank Bonus of +1 for each extra rank behind the first, up to the maximum determined by its troop type. How many models a rank must contain to claim a Rank Bonus, as well as the maximum Rank Bonus a unit can claim, is determined by its troop type.Note that this bonus can be claimed for an incomplete rear rank, as long as there are sufficient models in it.

Standards (Multiple Combats),290,https://tow.whfb.app/the-combat-phase/standards-multiple-combats,"Rulebook, p. 153","Regardless of how many units engaged in a single combat have standards, you may only claim the combat result bonus granted by a single standard. If one or more of those standards grants additional bonuses (as many magic standards do, for example), you may choose which standard to count.As most armies can only include a single Battle Standard, this is counted as normal, regardless of how many units are engaged in the combat."
Flank & Rear Attacks (Multiple Combats),291,https://tow.whfb.app/the-combat-phase/flank-and-rear-attacks-multiple-combats,"Rulebook, p. 153","Bonuses for flank and rear attacks can only be earned once per enemy unit – having multiple units engaging the same enemy unit in either its flank or in its rear does not grant additional bonuses.For example, if you have two units engaging a single enemy unit in combat, each of which is engaging a different flank of that unit, you can only claim a single flank attack bonus. However, if one unit is engaging the enemy unit's flank and the other is engaging the enemy unit's rear, you can claim both the flank attack and the rear attack bonus."
The High Ground (Multiple Combats),292,https://tow.whfb.app/the-combat-phase/the-high-ground-multiple-combats,"Rulebook, p. 153","Only a single unit engaged in a multiple combat can claim the combat result bonus granted for the high ground.

Break Test,294,https://tow.whfb.app/the-combat-phase/break-test,"Rulebook, p. 154","Unless the combat is a draw, each unit belonging to the losing side must make a 'Break' test. To make a Break test, roll 2D6 and modify the result by adding the difference between the winner's and the loser's combat result scores.Then, compare the result to the unit's Leadership characteristic (remember, a unit that contains models with different Leadership values will always use the highest):If the result of the natural roll is higher than the unit's Leadership, the unit 'Breaks' and flees.If the result of the natural roll is equal to or lower than the unit's Leadership, but the modified result is higher than the unit's Leadership, the unit Falls Back in Good Order.If the modified result is equal to or lower than the unit's Leadership, or if the roll is a natural double 1, the unit Gives Ground.Note that, unlike other tests you may be required to make, a Break test has three possible outcomes. These are intended to reflect the way in which opposing battle lines push forward and are pressed back before ultimately becoming overwhelmed and breaking."
Loser Breaks & Flees,295,https://tow.whfb.app/the-combat-phase/loser-breaks-and-flees,"Rulebook, p. 154","The losing unit Breaks, immediately turning tail and fleeing.

If the Unit Strength of the winning side is more than twice that of the losing side, any losing unit that rolled this result when making its Break test will Break instead.Note that Unit Strength is worked out at the end of the Combat phase, not at the beginning, and that where you have several units engaged in a single combat, you must add together the Unit Strength of each to determine the Unit Strength of your side."
"1"" Apart (Combat)",297,https://tow.whfb.app/the-combat-phase/1-apart-combat,"Rulebook, p. 154","If a unit that Breaks or Falls Back in Good Order is still in base contact with one or more enemy units after moving, the players should nudge the units apart, by the smallest amount possible, to maintain the 1"" rule.

Loser Gives Ground,298,https://tow.whfb.app/the-combat-phase/loser-gives-ground,"Rulebook, p. 155","The losing unit Gives Ground, breaking contact with, and moving 2"" directly away from, the enemy unit(s) without turning, pivoting or otherwise changing its facing in any way, stopping immediately should it come into contact with another unit or terrain, or if continuing to move would bring it within a 1"" of another enemy unit.When a unit Gives Ground in this way, it must move as directly as possible away from all of the enemy units engaging it, and must break from base contact with the victorious enemy unit(s), as shown in Fig 155.1.Most often this will mean that the losing unit simply moves 2"" backwards or sideways, directly away from a single enemy unit. At other times, especially if a unit is engaged by enemy units in two adjacent arcs (for example, a unit that has been charged in both its front and a flank arc), this will cause the unit to move diagonally away from two or more enemy units.Unit A must Give Ground. In order to move as directly as possible away from both units B and C, it cannot simply move as shown by the red lines.

Restrain & Reform,301,https://tow.whfb.app/the-combat-phase/restrain-and-reform,"Rulebook, p. 156","Most units may attempt to 'restrain and reform', rather than making a follow up or pursuit move, by making a 'Restraint' test.

Follow Up,302,https://tow.whfb.app/the-combat-phase/follow-up,"Rulebook, p. 156","A unit can make a 'follow up' move when an enemy unit it was engaged in combat with Gives Ground.

The Psychology of War,334,https://tow.whfb.app/the-psychology-of-war,"Rulebook, p. 160","The battlefield is full of noise, confusion and death. Faced with allies and comrades meeting grisly ends all around whilst battling fearsome foes, you may find that your warriors succumb to panic and scatter, rather than fight on.The psychological trauma of battle can cause even the bravest of warriors to panic, and when they do they are likely to flee. Consequently, panic (and more importantly, resisting the urge to give in to panic) plays an important role in Warhammer: the Old World."
Panic Tests,335,https://tow.whfb.app/the-psychology-of-war/panic-tests,"Rulebook, p. 160","Panic tests have been covered briefly in previous sections, particularly in the Shooting section. In the following sections, Panic tests and their causes are covered in greater detail. A Panic test is a test made to determine if a unit can hold its nerve and follow orders under tremendous pressure. If two or more units from the same army have to make Panic tests at the same time, the controlling player chooses the order in which the tests are made. To make a Panic test, test against the unit's Leadership characteristic:If this test is failed, the unit has succumbed to panic and must either Fall Back in Good Order or flee (see below).If this test is passed, the unit remains resolute in the face of enemy fire and does not panic.What happens to a unit that fails a Panic test will depend upon how many casualties that unit has suffered. A unit that has suffered only a few casualties will retreat, but will quickly rally, whereas a unit that has suffered a significant amount of casualties will turn tail and flee.Fall Back in Good OrderIf more than half (50%) of the models the unit contained at the start of the battle still remain, it will Fall Back in Good Order.FleeIf only half (50%), or fewer than half, of the models the unit contained at the start of the battle still remain, it will immediately turn tail and flee."

Common Causes of Panic,337,https://tow.whfb.app/the-psychology-of-war/common-causes-of-panic,"Rulebook, p. 161","There are many special rules, spells and magic items that can cause an enemy to make a Panic test.

However, there are certain circumstances that arise regularly in games which always cause units affected to make a Panic test."
Heavy Casualties,338,https://tow.whfb.app/the-psychology-of-war/heavy-casualties,"Rulebook, p. 161","If, during any single phase other than the Combat phase, a unit loses more than a quarter (25%) of the models it contained at the start of that phase, it must make a Panic test.A unit that fails a Panic test caused by heavy casualties will flee directly away from the enemy unit that caused those casualties. If the casualties were not caused by an enemy unit, the unit will instead flee from the nearest enemy unit which is not itself fleeing.Note that heavy casualties caused during the Combat phase do not cause Panic tests. During combat, the urgency of defeating the enemy and driving them back (represented by calculating combat results and making Break tests) takes precedence."
Nearby Friend Destroyed,339,https://tow.whfb.app/the-psychology-of-war/nearby-friend-destroyed,"Rulebook, p. 161","If a unit with a Unit Strength of 5 or more is destroyed, all friendly units within 6"" must immediately make a Panic test.Leave the destroyed unit in place until the tests are made in order to give a point to measure from. Once all tests have been made, any unit that failed its Panic test will flee directly away from the nearest enemy unit which is not itself fleeing."

Once all tests have been made, any unit that failed its Panic test will flee directly away from the nearest enemy unit which is not itself fleeing.Note that it does not matter if the unit that lost combat Breaks and flees or Falls Back in Good Order as, amidst the clamour of battle, friendly units are seldom able to tell the difference."
Fled Through,341,https://tow.whfb.app/the-psychology-of-war/fled-through,"Rulebook, p. 161","A unit must immediately make a Panic test if a friendly unit moves through it whilst fleeing or falling back in good order. For simplicity, resolve the movement of the fleeing unit before making and resolving the Panic test.A unit that fails a Panic test after being fled through will flee directly away from the nearest enemy unit which is not itself fleeing.Note that this can prove the most destructive form of panic, as one unit can panic and flee through another unit, which in turn might panic and flee through a further unit, and so on until your battle line is in total disarray."
Special Rules,342,https://tow.whfb.app/special-rules,"Rulebook, p. 165",A game of Warhammer: the Old World is packed with fantastic creatures and skilled warriors with abilities so incredible and varied that the basic rules cannot possibly cover them all. For such circumstances we have special rules – uncommon rules to govern uncommon circumstances.
What are Special Rules?,343,https://tow.whfb.app/special-rules/what-are-special-rules,"Rulebook, p. 165","When a creature has an ability that deviates in some way from the core game rules, it is represented by a special rule. It is through the use of the special rules that Dragons breathe fire, assassins strike with lightning speed and Giants cause bowel-loosening terror in their enemies.Special rules fall into three broad categories:Universal Special RulesArmy Special RulesUnique Special Rule"
Universal Special Rules,344,https://tow.whfb.app/special-rules/universal-special-rules,"Rulebook, p. 165","These are rules that can appear in all armies. They may be attached to a model itself, or to an item of equipment it carries."

What Special Rules Does it Have?,347,https://tow.whfb.app/special-rules/what-special-rules-does-it-have,"Rulebook, p. 165","Whilst many special rules are given directly to a model, a model can also gain special rules from its equipment. Most often, this will take the form of special rules attached to weapons, but special rules can be granted by armour and, especially in the case of characters, by magic items.A model might also gain special rules as the result of a spell that has been cast upon it or by some other game effect, possibly by the rules governing a terrain feature, for example. Where this is the case, the description of the game effect in question will make it clear."
Rule Priority,348,https://tow.whfb.app/special-rules/rule-priority,"Rulebook, p. 165","Sometimes, special rules can seem a bit contradictory. Army special rules take precedence over universal special rules or rules associated with a model's troop type. Unique special rules take precedence over universal special rules, army special rules or rules associated with a model's troop type."
Cumulative Special Rules,349,https://tow.whfb.app/special-rules/cumulative-special-rules,"Rulebook, p. 165","Unless noted otherwise, if the effect of a special rule in some way alters a characteristic, the result of a dice roll, or any other value (such as a model's armour value), that effect is cumulative. This means that the effects of duplicate versions of the same rule combine together, increasing its effect.For example, if a model is under the effects of a spell that grants it Armour Bane (2) and carries a weapon that has Armour Bane (1), the model would be considered to have Armour Bane (3)."

In addition, all models in the unit must be arranged in a formation that consists of one or more horizontal rows, called ranks, and a number of vertical rows, called files.As far as possible, there must be the same number of models in each rank.

Combat Order (Open Order),433,https://tow.whfb.app/unusual-formations/combat-order-open-order,"Rulebook, p. 183","An Open Order formation that is wider than it is deep (i.e., that has more models per rank than per file) or that is square (i.e., has the same number of models per file as per rank) is said to be in Combat Order. Such units are able to count a Rank Bonus in certain situations:Rank BonusIf a unit in Open Order formation is wide enough, it can claim a Rank Bonus of +1 for each rank behind the first, up to the maximum determined by its troop type:How many models a rank must contain to claim a Rank Bonus, as well as the maximum Rank Bonus a unit can claim, is determined by its troop type.Certain special rules may increase the Rank Bonus a unit can claim beyond the maximum normally allowed by its troop type.Note that, as normal, this bonus can be claimed for an incomplete rear rank, as long as there are sufficient models in it."

Coherency,437,https://tow.whfb.app/unusual-formations/coherency,"Rulebook, p. 184","A unit of Skirmishers must end its movement as a coherent unit, as described. When removing casualties from a unit of Skirmishers, you cannot remove a model if doing so would cause the unit to lose its coherency – you must instead remove a different model.Should it ever occur that a unit of Skirmishers has lost its coherency, you must remove models from play as casualties until only a single, coherent group remains. In such cases, the models removed are assumed to have fled the battle in a most cowardly fashion."

To represent this, whilst in Skirmish formation, models do not have flank or rear arcs. Instead, every arc is considered to be their front arc, giving Skirmishers a 360° vision arc. Therefore, units in Skirmish formation can declare charges and shoot in any direction – they are not limited by the constraints of a 90° front arc or vision arc.Other units can see through units in Skirmish formation if a line of sight can be drawn between the individual models.

Skirmishers in Combat,445,https://tow.whfb.app/unusual-formations/skirmishers-in-combat,"Rulebook, p. 185","When engaged in combat, Skirmishers do not remain in their usual, dispersed formation. Instead, they will 'form up' into base contact with one another, edge-to-edge and front corner to front corner, against the enemy in order to create a fighting rank. Skirmishers that charge the enemy, or that are themselves charged by the enemy, must always form up in this way once contact is made. Any Skirmishers that cannot make base contact with the enemy cannot form part of the fighting rank and must instead form up into ranks behind the fighting rank.Skirmishers will maintain this close formation until the combat is over (i.e., until they are not engaged with any enemy at the end of a Combat phase), at which point they will once again adopt Skirmish formation."

Skirmishers & Charging,449,https://tow.whfb.app/unusual-formations/skirmishers-and-charging,"Rulebook, p. 186","A unit of Skirmishers may charge an enemy that is visible to at least one of its models when charges are declared. In which arc the enemy is charged is determined as normal.When a unit of Skirmishers charges, each model is moved individually, starting with the model closest to the charge target, as shown in Fig 186.1. Each model moves as directly as possible towards the charge target in order to make base contact with it and form a fighting rank. Models that cannot make base contact with the charge target must form up behind the fighting rank, as shown in Fig 186.2.Fig 186.1 - 1. The Skirmisher closest to the formed unit is moved into base contact.Fig 186.2 - 2. The remaining Skirmishers move. Seven can make base contact with the enemy, forming a fighting rank.

As usual, the charging unit may wheel once, at any point, during its move, as shown in Fig 186.3.Once the charging unit has made contact with the target unit, it does not wheel to align. Instead, the Skirmishers must form up against the fighting rank of the charging unit, as shown in Fig 186.4 and Fig 186.5.

Troop Types in Detail,452,https://tow.whfb.app/troop-types-in-detail,"Rulebook, p. 188","All models have a troop type. These, along with the type of formation units of such models adopt, determine how they function throughout the rules. Troop types were explained in brief. The following sections cover them in greater detail and present any additional rules that may apply, as well as providing more in-depth descriptions of what they represent."
Categories of Troop Type,453,https://tow.whfb.app/troop-types-in-detail/categories-of-troop-type,"Rulebook, p. 188","There are five main categories of troop type, each of which is further divided into sub-categories. For example, particularly large infantry fall into the monstrous infantry sub-category of infantry. In such cases, when the rules refer to infantry models or units, monstrous infantry must also follow those rules unless an exception is stated for monstrous infantry.A model's troop type also determines the minimum number of such models a rank must contain to claim a Rank Bonus, the maximum Rank Bonus a unit of such models is able to claim, and the Unit Strength of such a model, as shown in the sections that follow.In most cases it will be fairly obvious which main category of troop type a model falls into. Sub-categories are more complex and exist to help better understand the exact role of a unit in battle and to better reflect this in games through the use of different rules."
Characters (Troop Types),454,https://tow.whfb.app/troop-types-in-detail/characters-troop-types,"Rulebook, p. 188","Some models will have the word 'Character' in brackets after their troop type, indicating that the model is a character. This section does not cover characters in detail. Instead, and because characters are such a powerful and important part of Warhammer: the Old World, they have a section all to themselves.."
Troop Type Tables,455,https://tow.whfb.app/troop-types-in-detail/troop-type-tables,"Rulebook, p. 189","Each of the following categories is accompanied by a table containing a summary of the important information needed for that troop type:Models Per RankThis is the minimum number required to claim a Rank Bonus. Ranks can contain more models or fewer models, as you wish, but in order for a rank to count towards Rank Bonus, it must contain at least this many models.Maximum Rank BonusThis is the maximum Rank Bonus a unit can claim. In some cases this can be increased by special rules and other effects.Unit StrengthSometimes, you may be required to work out the 'Unit Strength' of a unit. There are a number of reasons you might need to know this, for example, to determine if one of your units is outnumbered by an enemy, and if they are, by how much. Simply counting the number of models does not account for the sheer power and destructive ability of large and ferocious creatures. Unit Strength represents this well.To determine Unit Strength, simply count the number of models currently in the unit and multiply this by the Unit Strength per model as shown on the Troop Type table."
Infantry,456,https://tow.whfb.app/troop-types-in-detail/infantry,"Rulebook, p. 190","Infantry includes all units of foot troops and forms the backbone of most armies.

Treat the model as having been completely destroyed and remove it from play.Note that a war machine that loses a round of combat may Fall Back in Good Order or Give Ground as normal."
Weapon of War,488,https://tow.whfb.app/troop-types-in-detail/weapon-of-war,"Rulebook, p. 197","War machines are built to be strong and durable rather than for speed and, as such, they are slow and cumbersome to move once erected. To represent this, war machines cannot march, declare a charge or make a pursuit move. Additionally, war machines suffer a -1 modifier to the result of any Flee roll they make (to a minimum of 1).However, a war machine can pivot freely at any time during its turn (the better to face the enemy) and may make a follow up move as normal. Should a war machine pivot, it does not count as having moved."
Command Groups,489,https://tow.whfb.app/command-groups,"Rulebook, p. 198","Not all models within a unit are created equal. It is quite normal for warriors to march into battle under the leadership of a seasoned officer or brave champion, with banners flying proud in the mist-strewn air, the pounding of drums and bellow of horns driving the warriors onward. A unit's champion, standard bearer and musician are collectively referred to as the unit's 'command group'.Most units can include a command group of some kind, as detailed in the relevant army list. Most can include what is referred to as 'full command' – a champion, standard bearer and musician – whilst others will only be able to include perhaps one or two of these options. Command group models are always purchased as upgrades to normal rank and file models in a unit, as described in the relevant army list.Note that, for the purposes of any rule that refers to 'rank and file models', models belonging to a command group are considered to be rank and file models unless stated otherwise."
What's in a Title?,490,https://tow.whfb.app/command-groups/whats-in-a-title,"Rulebook, p. 198","In most army lists, the term 'standard bearer' is used throughout, though the model in question might actually carry an icon, pennant or other such totem. Similarly, a 'musician' might bear a drum, flute, horn, zither, hurdy-gurdy or some other weird and wonderful instrument – they will still be described as a musician.Champions differ somewhat – they will often be given a rank or name specific to their unit or army. Whatever this may be, they follow all the rules for a unit champion given here."
Position Within the Unit,491,https://tow.whfb.app/command-groups/position-within-the-unit,"Rulebook, p. 198","Except in rare cases, a command group will be found in the forefront of the fighting, leading by example. Unless noted otherwise, the models that make up a unit's command group must be placed in the front rank of the unit, as close to the centre of the rank as possible. If the command group includes a standard bearer, this model should take precedence in the centre of the rank (or as close to the centre as is possible), with other members of the command group placed to either side."
Not Enough Room,492,https://tow.whfb.app/command-groups/not-enough-room,"Rulebook, p. 198","Sometimes there is not enough room in the front rank for the command group to fit. Should this occur, as many command group models as possible must be placed in the front rank and any remaining models are placed in the rank behind."
"""Make Way!""",493,https://tow.whfb.app/command-groups/make-way,"Rulebook, p. 198","If the unit turns or reforms, the command group automatically pushes its way back to the front.

Champions,494,https://tow.whfb.app/command-groups/champions,"Rulebook, p. 199","Most units can include just one champion, but some can include more. Champions are extremely skilled or tough, and comrades look to them for leadership and take pride in their prowess."
Characteristics (Champions),495,https://tow.whfb.app/command-groups/characteristics-champions,"Rulebook, p. 199",A unit's champion usually has slightly better characteristics than their fellows. These will be shown in the model's profile.
Equipment (Champions),496,https://tow.whfb.app/command-groups/equipment-champions,"Rulebook, p. 199","Usually, champions count as having the same equipment as the other members of their unit, regardless of the equipment shown on the model.

To make a ""Look Out, Sir!"" roll, roll a D6. On a roll of 1, the champion is hit. On a roll of 2+, another member of the unit is hit in the champion's place."
Combat (Champions),503,https://tow.whfb.app/command-groups/combat-champions,"Rulebook, p. 199",A champion is not counted amongst casualties caused by enemy attacks in combat unless:They are the last remaining model in the unit.The attacks were directed against the champion by enemy models in base contact.Note that any excess wounds inflicted upon a champion do not 'spill over' onto their unit.
Standard Bearers,504,https://tow.whfb.app/command-groups/standard-bearers,"Rulebook, p. 200","A unit often fights beneath a standard or banner of some kind; a glorious token of their allegiance, history and pride.

Characteristics & Equipment (Standard Bearers),505,https://tow.whfb.app/command-groups/characteristics-and-equipment-standard-bearers,"Rulebook, p. 200","A standard bearer always has the same characteristics as the other models in their unit. Similarly, they are always considered to be equipped in the same way as the other models in their unit.In reality, a model that represents a standard bearer will likely be equipped differently, often not carrying a shield, or replacing a weapon with the standard, for example. Any such deficiency in terms of equipment is compensated for by the efforts of those around them to protect their standard."
Combat Result Bonus (Standard Bearers),506,https://tow.whfb.app/command-groups/combat-result-bonus-standard-bearers,"Rulebook, p. 200","As described in the Combat section, a unit with a standard will be inspired to fight all the harder.

Trophies of War (Command Groups),507,https://tow.whfb.app/command-groups/trophies-of-war-command-groups,"Rulebook, p. 200","The standards of defeated enemies are highly prized as trophies, so an army will collect as many as it can, drawing great satisfaction from their enemy's shame. If a fleeing unit is run down by an enemy unit, or if a unit is destroyed in combat by an enemy unit, its standard is claimed as a trophy.Standards claimed in this way are worth bonus Victory Points at the end of the battle. Once a standard has been lost in this way, it cannot be reclaimed.Note that if a unit is destroyed by any means other than being run down whilst fleeing or being destroyed in combat (by enemy shooting, for example), its banner is not claimed by the enemy as a trophy of war."
Standard Bearers As Casualties,508,https://tow.whfb.app/command-groups/standard-bearers-as-casualties,"Rulebook, p. 200","If a standard bearer model is slain, another rank and file model belonging to the same unit, but that is not a command group model, will step forward to raise the fallen standard. Therefore, a unit cannot lose its standard bearer unless it and the champion (if there is one) are the last two remaining models in the unit. This applies even if the standard bearer is targeted by an attack that allows a specific model within a unit to be targeted, or finds themselves lying underneath a template.If the only other remaining model in a unit is the champion, the standard bearer must be removed as a casualty before the champion."
Musicians,509,https://tow.whfb.app/command-groups/musicians,"Rulebook, p. 201","When an army marches, it does so to the inspirational beat of drums and blare of horns (or the doot of a spectral flute).

"""Onwards To Victory!""",511,https://tow.whfb.app/command-groups/onwards-to-victory,"Rulebook, p. 201","If, once the combat result has been calculated, both sides have the exact same number of points each, the side that has a musician in the front rank of one or more of its units may claim a bonus of +1 combat result point.If, however, the opposing side has a musician also, the redoubled efforts (and almighty clamour) cancel each other out and neither side may claim this bonus."
Steadying Rhythm,512,https://tow.whfb.app/command-groups/steadying-rhythm,"Rulebook, p. 201","If a fleeing unit contains a musician, it may apply a +1 modifier to its Leadership characteristic whenever it attempts to rally, up to a maximum of Leadership 10."

This applies even if the musician is targeted by an attack that allows a specific model within a unit to be targeted, or finds themselves lying underneath a template.If the only other remaining models in a unit are the champion and standard bearer, the musician must be removed as a casualty before either."
Characters,515,https://tow.whfb.app/characters,"Rulebook, p. 202","The Warhammer world would not be what it is without the presence of great lords, valiant heroes and mighty Wizards. Such powerful individuals add a new dimension to your games of Warhammer: the Old World, either as inspiring leaders or skilled warriors able to trounce hordes of lesser fighters. Such potent personages are called 'characters'.Characters are generally known by different names appropriate to their nation or race. Orc characters, for example, are known by suitably 'Orcy' names, such as Boss and Warboss, whilst the leaders of the Empire are Captains, Warrior Priests and Engineers.The types of character available to an army will vary to reflect the personality of that army. Most races of the Warhammer world can call upon the services of powerful fighters and wise Wizards in equal measure, some have unique types of specialist character, and a few have jack-of-all-trades characters that are adept in many different aspects of war."
Character Models,516,https://tow.whfb.app/characters/character-models,"Rulebook, p. 202","Character models are a special type of unit that can either operate on their own, or that can join another unit belonging to their army.

Characters & Troop Type,526,https://tow.whfb.app/characters/characters-and-troop-type,"Rulebook, p. 204","Just like any other model, character models have a troop type. In most cases, this will be a sub-category of infantry, although some characters, such as Greater Daemons of Chaos, are so large that their troop type will be a sub-category of monster.

Mounted Characters,527,https://tow.whfb.app/characters/mounted-characters,"Rulebook, p. 204","Many characters ride into battle atop a mount of some kind.

Targeting Lone Characters,536,https://tow.whfb.app/characters/targeting-lone-characters,"Rulebook, p. 206","A Lone character might offer a desirable target for enemy shooting or spell casting, but picking out any one individual from the bustle of the enemy battle line is difficult to say the least.

Characters 1 and 2 are both within 3"" of a friendly unit (unit B), but character 3 is not. However, despite being within 3"" of a friendly unit, character 2 is the closest target.

Positioning Characters,541,https://tow.whfb.app/characters/positioning-characters,"Rulebook, p. 207","When a character joins a unit they are placed in its front rank, displacing one or more rank and file models (not including command group models) to the rear rank as required, as shown in Fig 207.1.

When required to determine line of sight for the character (for example, when casting a spell), do so from the character model itself as normal. In such cases, the unit does not block the character's line of sight.If required to determine line of sight to the character, do so to the character model itself.

Movement (Characters),545,https://tow.whfb.app/characters/movement-characters,"Rulebook, p. 208","A unit that has been joined by a character moves as normal, the character model moving as part of the unit. A character model that is positioned adjacent to the unit must remain adjacent to, and in base contact with, the front rank of the unit at the end of its movement.A unit that has been joined by a character always uses the Movement characteristic of the slowest model. If either is subject to any movement restrictions, these apply to both. For example, if a unit with M8 is joined by a character with M4, the unit can only move 4""."
Moving Through the Ranks,546,https://tow.whfb.app/characters/moving-through-the-ranks,"Rulebook, p. 208","A character whose unit is engaged in combat may sometimes be required to 'move through the ranks'. To do so, simply move the character model (displacing other models as required) so that it occupies the desired space, within or adjacent to the appropriate rank, as shown in Fig 208.1 and 208.2.A character that moves through the ranks to occupy a space anywhere other than within the front rank of their unit must return to their previous position immediately once their unit is no longer engaged in combat.Fig 208.1 - Unit A, which has a character within its front rank, has been charged in its flank.

The number given indicates the weapon's maximum range.If the weapon has two Range characteristics, both shown as a number of inches, the first is its minimum range, the second its maximum. For example, a stone thrower has a Range of 12-60"", meaning it can only shoot at things which lie between 12"" and 60"" away. Anything less than 12"" away is too close.Strength (S)The weapon's Strength is used when making rolls To Wound against the enemy. For missile weapons, this is shown as a simple numerical value. For combat weapons this may be shown as 'S', indicating that the Strength of the wielder is used, or as 'S' with a modifier (for example, 'S+2'), meaning the Strength of the wielder is used but with a modifier applied.Armour Piercing (AP)This shows how good the weapon is at punching through armour. This is always a negative modifier, which is applied to the dice rolled when making an Armour Save roll.Special RulesMany weapons confer a universal special rule to attacks made by their wielder.NotesSome weapons have notes specifying when they can be used (such as during a turn in which the wielder charged), when their modifiers apply (such as only during the first round of combat), or what type of model can wield them (such as 'models whose troop type is 'cavalry' only').

No Armour,606,https://tow.whfb.app/weapons-of-war/no-armour,"Rulebook, p. 220","A model that wears no armour is considered to have an armour value of 7+ for the purposes of Armour Save roll modifiers and any rules that improve armour value. This represents the model's natural resilience and the protection proffered by the clothing and jewellery it wears, however little this may be. For example, if a model with no armour carries a shield, it would have an armour value of 6+."
Unusual Armour,607,https://tow.whfb.app/weapons-of-war/unusual-armour,"Rulebook, p. 221","In addition to the armour types listed here, many armies have access to unique materials or spell craft which can enhance their armour still further. This is usually represented by an army special rule which represents these types of armour."
Additional Equipment,608,https://tow.whfb.app/weapons-of-war/additional-equipment,"Rulebook, p. 221","Many models carry equipment (or have the option to carry equipment) that improves upon their armour value.

Shield,609,https://tow.whfb.app/weapons-of-war/shield,"Rulebook, p. 221","A shield may be a simple wooden board, or it may be an ornate and finely decorated thing – layers of wood, leather and resin trimmed and faced with beaten metal and finished with carefully painted symbols and heraldry. Whatever form it takes, shields are carried by warriors of all races.A model that carries a shield improves its armour value by 1. For example, a model equipped with light armour has an armour value of 6+. Should that model also carry a shield, its armour value would be improved by 1 by lowering the target number from 6+ to 5+.Note that if a model uses a weapon that has the Requires Two Hands special rule in combat, it cannot also use a shield."
Barding,610,https://tow.whfb.app/weapons-of-war/barding,"Rulebook, p. 221","Barding is the name given to the armour worn by a mount. This can take many forms, from heavy cloth draperies, to formed and fitted armour plates. Barding is seen often on the mounts of cavalry, but only rarely upon monsters ridden by characters (it is a challenge to tailor a suit of barding to an unwilling gryphon!).A model that rides a barded mount improves its armour value by 1.

War Machines,612,https://tow.whfb.app/war-machines,"Rulebook, p. 222","War machines are mechanical constructions that hurl massive projectiles at the foe. Bolt throwers, cannon and stone throwers are all war machines, and there are many other bizarre contraptions to be found in the Warhammer world.The following sections present the rules and weapon profiles for the most commonly seen types of war machine. Still more exotic types can be found in the various army lists, representing war machines unique to a certain race. For the most part, these exotic war machines will use the rules presented here with a few minor alterations or additional special rules, the better to reflect their unique nature.For clarity, any war machine that uses one of the profiles presented here will have the name of the weapon and profile given as part of its 'equipment'."
Basing War Machines,613,https://tow.whfb.app/war-machines/basing-war-machines,"Rulebook, p. 222","Although war machines and their crew are treated as a single model, the models that represent the crew are most often based individually, separate to the war machine itself. Accordingly, a war machine’s profile will give a base size for both the war machine and its crew. The benefit of basing a war machine’s crew separately is that, for each Wound the crew loses, you can remove one of the crew models as a reminder.During deployment, the models representing a war machine’s crew should be positioned adjacent to and in base contact with it. Once placed, the models must remain in position, adjacent to their war machine. Individual crew models should be ignored for the purposes of measurement or when determining line of sight.However, many players like to base their war machines and crew together on a single large base, making of their war machines small dioramas that show the crew hard at work. This is perfectly acceptable."
Bolt Throwers,614,https://tow.whfb.app/war-machines/bolt-throwers,"Rulebook, p. 223","Bolt throwers are huge crossbows that shoot spear-sized missiles.

Through & Through,615,https://tow.whfb.app/war-machines/through-and-through,"Rulebook, p. 223","A bolt thrower shot can cut through several ranks of troops. If the target of a bolt thrower is a formed unit of any type (be it Close Order, Open Order and so on), and if the roll To Hit is successful, the shot causes:One hit per rank (including the rear rank, even if it is incomplete), if the bolt thrower lies in the unit’s front or rear arc.One hit per file, if the bolt thrower lies in the unit’s flank arc.However, a bolt can quickly lose power as it passes through armour and flesh. To represent this, the bolt thrower suffers a -1 modifier to its Strength characteristic for each hit after the first.Note that, should the Strength of a hit be reduced to 0, it has no effect and no further hits are caused.Fig 223.1 - The bolt thrower lies within the enemy unit's flank arc, causing one hit per file.

Bombardment,618,https://tow.whfb.app/war-machines/bombardment,"Rulebook, p. 224","When shooting with this weapon, work your way through the following steps:1. Choose Target: Choose an enemy unit that is within the war machine’s line of sight and between its minimum and maximum range to be the target and place the blast template so that its central hole is directly over the centre of that unit.2. Scatter: Once the template has been placed, it will scatter. Roll an Artillery dice and a Scatter dice:If a 'Misfire' is rolled on the Artillery dice, something has gone horribly wrong. Roll immediately on the appropriate Misfire table to determine exactly what.If a 'Hit!' is rolled on the Scatter dice, the shot has landed on target and the number shown on the Artillery dice is ignored.If an arrow is rolled on the Scatter dice, move the template a number of inches equal to the roll of the Artillery dice in the direction the arrow points.3. Damage: Any model whose base lies underneath the template risks being hit:A single model whose base lies underneath the central hole of the blast template is struck by the projectile and suffers a hit with higher Strength and Armour Piercing characteristics, as shown in brackets on the war machine's profile.All other hits are resolved using the war machine's normal Strength and Armour Piercing characteristics.Fig 224.1 - 16 models lie underneath the blast template. 4 are hit automatically, 12 are hit on a D6 roll of 4+."
Indirect Fire,619,https://tow.whfb.app/war-machines/indirect-fire,"Rulebook, p. 225","A weapon that shoots using the Bombardment special rule can do so even if it cannot draw a line of sight to its target by hurling a shot high into the sky, passing over intervening regiments and even terrain. However, such indirect fire is inaccurate at best, as the war machine’s crew have to guess where their foe lies, based upon information provided by scouts.If you wish to fire indirectly, declare that you will do so before taking the war machine’s shot. An indirect shot does not require a line of sight to the target unit, but is otherwise treated as a normal shot.An indirect shot is not as accurate as one where the crew can see their target:If an arrow is rolled on the Scatter dice, resolve the scatter as normal.If a 'Hit!' is rolled on the Scatter dice, the shot does not land on target (as would normally be the case) but merely scatters less – how much less depends greatly on the skill of the crew. Use the small arrow above the Hit! symbol to determine the direction of the scatter and move the template a number of inches equal to the roll of the Artillery dice minus the crew’s Ballistic Skill characteristic (to a minimum of zero)."

Cannon Fire,622,https://tow.whfb.app/war-machines/cannon-fire,"Rulebook, p. 226","1. Choose Target Point: Choose a point within both the war machine's line of sight and maximum range. This does not have to be an enemy model; it can be a point on the ground. Once you have chosen your target point, mark it with a small marker.2. Fire: Once the target point has been marked, roll an Artillery dice:If a 'Misfire' is rolled, something has gone horribly wrong. Roll immediately on the appropriate Misfire table to determine exactly what.If a number is rolled, move the target point marker that many inches, directly away from the cannon. This is the ‘strike point’ – the point at which the cannonball strikes the ground.3. Bounce: Unless the cannon misfired, the cannonball will bounce from the strike point, tearing through anything in its path. To determine how far the cannonball bounces, roll another Artillery dice:If a 'Misfire' is rolled, the cannonball buries itself in the ground and comes to a rest.If a number is rolled, the cannonball bounces, as shown in Fig 226.1. Measure the distance of the bounce from the strike point, directly away from the cannon.Fig 226.1 - The first roll of the Artillery dice is a 2, meaning the cannonball strikes the ground 2"" ahead of the target point. The second roll is an 8, so the cannonball bounces 8"".4. Determine Hits: Once the strike point and the distance of the bounce have been established, it is time to determine which models (if any) have been hit:Any model whose base lies underneath the strike point is hit automatically.Any model whose base lies under the path of the bouncing cannonball is hit automatically.However, should a cannonball bounce through a formed unit, it can hit a maximum of:One model per rank, if the cannon lies in the unit’s front or rear arc.One model per file, if the cannon lies in the unit’s flank arc. Models that lie fully beyond the distance of the bounce are not hit.5. Crunch: Sometimes, a bouncing cannonball will encounter something that stops it dead:If the cannonball hits a model whose troop type is monstrous creature or behemoth, it stops immediately.

How Much Terrain?,632,https://tow.whfb.app/battlefield-terrain/how-much-terrain,"Rulebook, p. 268","If there is too much terrain, units will struggle to manoeuvre. If there is too little, the battlefield will be sparse and uninteresting. The best guide is to use one terrain feature per 12"" of longest table edge (rounded up to the nearest 12""). For example, if the longest table edge is 72"", six features should suffice."
The Size of Things,633,https://tow.whfb.app/battlefield-terrain/the-size-of-things,"Rulebook, p. 268","As a rule, a terrain feature should be no less than 2"" and no more than 12"" across at its widest point. If it is less than 2"" across at its widest point, it should be treated as battlefield decoration rather than terrain.To determine how the size of terrain affects how much you should use, follow this simple guide:Between 2"" and 8"" at its widest point – counts as one terrain feature.Between 8"" and 12"" at its widest point – counts as two terrain features.More than 12"" at its widest point – counts as three terrain features."
Placing Terrain,634,https://tow.whfb.app/battlefield-terrain/placing-terrain,"Rulebook, p. 268","Some scenarios include guidance on the terrain features to include and where on the battlefield they should be placed. Most of the time, especially if playing a simple pitched battle, the placement of the terrain is left to the players. The recommended way to do this is as follows:Determine how many terrain features to set up, based on the size of your battlefield.From the terrain available, each player chooses a number of features, up to the maximum number of features needed.Once both players have chosen, the winner of a roll-off places the first terrain feature.Players then take turns to place a single terrain feature from all of those chosen until the agreed number of terrain features have been placed. Any unused terrain features are set aside.Players can place terrain features anywhere on the battlefield, but not within 12"" of a terrain feature placed by their opponent, and not within 12"" of the centre of the battlefield. The only exception to this are special features, which must be placed within 12"" of the centre of the battlefield.Should the players agree, or should the scenario require it, battlefield decorations can be placed in the same manner."
Categories of Terrain,635,https://tow.whfb.app/battlefield-terrain/categories-of-terrain,"Rulebook, p. 269","Terrain is divided into seven categories: open ground, difficult, dangerous and impassable terrain, linear obstacles (including both low and high), woods and hills."
Open Ground,636,https://tow.whfb.app/battlefield-terrain/open-ground,"Rulebook, p. 269","Any terrain not specifically classed as something else is to be treated as open ground. Open ground can be almost anything – grassy fields, sandy flats, sunparched earth, and so on."
Difficult Terrain,637,https://tow.whfb.app/battlefield-terrain/difficult-terrain,"Rulebook, p. 269","This includes any rough ground that might cause those attempting to cross it to struggle. This can include scrub, rocky ground, shallow streams or fords, even thick mud. Most woods will also count as difficult terrain.If any part of a unit moves through difficult terrain, that unit suffers a -1 modifier to its Movement characteristic (to a minimum of 1). This modifier is applied whether the unit begins its movement in difficult terrain, passes through difficult terrain during its movement, or ends its movement in difficult terrain.Should a unit charge through difficult terrain, it makes its Charge roll as normal by rolling 2D6, but must discard the highest result, rather than the lowest. Therefore, when charging through terrain, the lowest result is the result of the Charge roll.Finally, a unit that ends its movement or begins a Combat phase with a quarter (25%) or more of its models within difficult terrain becomes Disrupted and cannot claim a Rank Bonus."
Dangerous Terrain,638,https://tow.whfb.app/battlefield-terrain/dangerous-terrain,"Rulebook, p. 269","Some terrain can present a very real risk to life and limb. This might include particularly rocky ground, deep swamps, fast flowing rivers, and even unnatural or magical terrain features. Particularly dense and dangerous woods or steep and rock strewn hills can also be counted as dangerous terrain.Dangerous terrain hinders movement just like difficult terrain. In addition, any model (on its own or within a unit) that either begins its movement in dangerous terrain, passes through dangerous terrain during its movement, or ends its movement in dangerous terrain must make a Dangerous Terrain test. To make a Dangerous Terrain test, roll a D6. On a roll of 2+, the model successfully negotiates the dangers of the terrain without incident. On a roll of 1, the model has suffered a terrible mishap and loses a single Wound.For the purposes of combat, dangerous terrain is treated as difficult terrain.Note that a model must make a Dangerous Terrain test for each separate dangerous terrain feature it encounters during a single move."
Impassable Terrain,639,https://tow.whfb.app/battlefield-terrain/impassable-terrain,"Rulebook, p. 270","Impassable terrain is any terrain that completely blocks movement. This includes rock spires, deep rivers, sheer cliffs and most buildings, as well as high linear obstacles such as castle walls and fortifications.Impassable terrain cannot be crossed during the course of a battle – units must go around it. In addition, if it is not possible to align a charging unit to the enemy unit due to the presence of impassable terrain, the charging unit has made a disordered charge."
Low & High Linear Obstacles,640,https://tow.whfb.app/battlefield-terrain/low-and-high-linear-obstacles,"Rulebook, p. 270","This category includes walls, hedges, fences; even ditches and furrows. A low linear obstacle is defined as being less than 2"" high. Anything that is 2"" high or more is a high linear obstacle."
Defended Low Linear Obstacles,641,https://tow.whfb.app/battlefield-terrain/defended-low-linear-obstacles,"Rulebook, p. 270","A unit behind a low linear obstacle can defend it by moving its front rank into base contact with the obstacle. Enemies can charge the defenders as normal but do not have to physically cross the obstacle. Instead, the front rank of a charging unit moves into base contact with the opposite side of the obstacle. Unless it has the Fly (X) special rule, a unit that charges an enemy behind a defended low linear obstacle makes a disordered charge."
High Linear Obstacles,642,https://tow.whfb.app/battlefield-terrain/high-linear-obstacles,"Rulebook, p. 270","For the purposes of movement and combat, high linear obstacles, such as castle walls, are treated as impassable terrain."
Woods,643,https://tow.whfb.app/battlefield-terrain/woods,"Rulebook, p. 270","Woods (or forests) are one of the most commonly seen battlefield terrain features. A wood might be classed as difficult, dangerous or even impassable terrain, based upon its size and density, and the feature as a whole will certainly obscure line of sight to a greater or lesser extent."
Woodland Boundaries,644,https://tow.whfb.app/battlefield-terrain/woodland-boundaries,"Rulebook, p. 270","A woodland terrain feature must have a clearly defined edge. This allows individual trees to be removed and replaced to facilitate the movement of models.Regardless of the position of any individual trees within the terrain feature, any model or unit counts as being behind partial cover as long as up to half of the model, or up to half of the models within the unit, is within the woods (i.e., within the terrain feature's clearly defined edge)."
Arboreal Gloom,645,https://tow.whfb.app/battlefield-terrain/arboreal-gloom,"Rulebook, p. 270","Woods of any size are dark places, filled with branches and trailing vines. Seeing clearly through such arboreal gloom is difficult to say the least. If a wood lies between two models and if neither model is within the wood, a line of sight can only be drawn between them if an uninterrupted line can be drawn between their bases without crossing over or through the wood."
Hills,646,https://tow.whfb.app/battlefield-terrain/hills,"Rulebook, p. 271","Hills are tactically important positions. Not only do they offer bonuses in combat to the unit that holds the high ground, they confer bonuses to shooting, allowing an additional rank to shoot. Hills in general are treated as open ground."
Vantage Point,647,https://tow.whfb.app/battlefield-terrain/vantage-point,"Rulebook, p. 271","A unit on a hill is in an ideal position to fire and is able to see over the heads of other units. To represent this, a unit on a hill can fire with one additional rank compared to a unit on flat ground.In addition, any unit that is entirely on a hill can draw a line of sight across or through other units or models that are not themselves on a hill. However, due to its elevated position, a unit that is entirely on a hill can also be seen more easily. Therefore, any unit that is not on a hill can draw a line of sight to a unit that is entirely on a hill across or through other units or models."
Beyond the Crest,648,https://tow.whfb.app/battlefield-terrain/beyond-the-crest,"Rulebook, p. 271","For all the advantages they offer, few things obstruct line of sight better than a hill. To represent this, if a hill lies between two models and if neither model is upon the hill, a line of sight can only be drawn between them if an uninterrupted line can be drawn between their bases without crossing over or through the hill."
Battlefield Decoration,649,https://tow.whfb.app/battlefield-terrain/battlefield-decoration,"Rulebook, p. 271","Very small decorative elements of terrain less than 2"" across at their widest point, such as a stack of barrels or a roadside shrine, are called 'battlefield decorations'. Such small features can be added to the battlefield in the same way as terrain and in the same quantities. In addition, some scenarios might specify that a number of battlefield decorations be included as objectives or as part of the narrative element of the scenario.Due to their small size, battlefield decorations rarely interfere with a battle. They are ignored for the purposes of both movement and combat, as if they were not there. Should the presence of such a battlefield decoration ever interfere with the positioning of units, simply make note of its position and move it aside, replacing it when it is convenient to do so. However, they may obscure a line of sight."
Combining Terrain Categories,650,https://tow.whfb.app/battlefield-terrain/combining-terrain-categories,"Rulebook, p. 271","Whilst most terrain features will fall neatly into one category, many will not. A hill may feature an impassable cliff on one side; a wooden fence may run through a forest, and so on.Whenever a terrain feature combines two terrain categories, the players should agree upon how to deal with it before the game starts. In most cases, this will be quite simple. If one side of a hill is a steep cliff, for example, it can be agreed that, on that side, the hill counts as impassable terrain."
Special Features,651,https://tow.whfb.app/battlefield-terrain/special-features,"Rulebook, p. 272","Special features are terrain features that represent an important landmark. Some scenarios will specify that a certain special feature should be set up on the battlefield. Otherwise, players can agree to include a special feature when setting up the battlefield."
Using Special Features,652,https://tow.whfb.app/battlefield-terrain/using-special-features,"Rulebook, p. 272","Unless specified by the scenario, only a single special feature should be used.

Placing Special Features,653,https://tow.whfb.app/battlefield-terrain/placing-special-features,"Rulebook, p. 272","Special features must be placed within 12"" of the centre of the battlefield."
Controlling a Special Feature,654,https://tow.whfb.app/battlefield-terrain/controlling-a-special-feature,"Rulebook, p. 272","Special features can be controlled by units and, therefore, by the army the unit belongs to. There are two ways in which a unit can control a special feature: proximity and occupancy."
Benefits of Control,655,https://tow.whfb.app/battlefield-terrain/benefits-of-control,"Rulebook, p. 272","Controlling a special feature grants a unit certain benefits which will often extend to other units in the same army. However, the benefits of controlling a special feature last only whilst it is controlled."
Proximity,656,https://tow.whfb.app/battlefield-terrain/proximity,"Rulebook, p. 272","Proximity means that a special feature can be controlled by a unit that is within 6"" of it, that has a Unit Strength of five or more and that is not fleeing. If two or more eligible, enemy units are within 6"", the unit closest to the special feature controls it. If two enemy units are equally close, the feature is 'contested' and neither unit controls it."
Occupancy,657,https://tow.whfb.app/battlefield-terrain/occupancy,"Rulebook, p. 272","Occupancy means that a special feature can only be controlled by a unit that is within it. A unit can occupy a special feature by moving into base contact with it during the Remaining Moves sub-phase of its Movement phase. Once its movement is complete, the unit is placed within the special feature. Whilst a unit occupies a special feature it:Cannot charge.Can shoot (and cast spells) and is considered to have a 360° vision arc from the special feature itself.Can be shot at (and be targeted by spells) by a unit (or Wizard) that can draw a line of sight to the special feature. However, the unit is considered to be behind full cover.All measurements to or from a unit that occupies a special feature are made to or from the base of the feature, rather than the individual model(s).Special features do not tend to be particularly large. Therefore, they can only be occupied by a single unit.Unless it is fleeing, a unit occupying a special feature can leave it during the Remaining Moves sub-phase of its Movement phase, by making a follow up move, or by pursuing an enemy. Simply place the unit in formation, so that at least one model is in base contact with the feature. The unit's movement then ends."

Warhammer Armies,662,https://tow.whfb.app/warhammer-armies,"Rulebook, p. 276","Building and painting a collection of models for Warhammer: the Old World is a satisfying experience and, it must be said, often a long term project. But as your collection grows, you will want to use it in games – to command your miniatures on the field of battle."
Points Values & Size of Game,663,https://tow.whfb.app/warhammer-armies/points-values-and-size-of-game,"Rulebook, p. 276","Prior to a game, the players must decide how many 'points' their armies will be worth. The higher the points value, the larger the game. The points value dictates the maximum points you can spend on your army. For example, if two players decide to play a 3,000 point game, the total points value of each player's army must be as close to 3,000 points as possible without exceeding the agreed limit."
Recommended Size of Game,664,https://tow.whfb.app/warhammer-armies/recommended-size-of-game,"Rulebook, p. 276","Quite what size a game should be depends largely upon how long the players want their game to last. Armies of 2,000 points will give players familiar with the rules a game that will last a couple of hours. Games with smaller armies can be played in less time, whereas a game with much larger armies might occupy most of a day. Players are encouraged to play games with different points values to find the size of game they most enjoy."
Minimum Three Units,665,https://tow.whfb.app/warhammer-armies/minimum-three-units,"Rulebook, p. 276","An army must include a minimum of three non-character units, not including units whose troop type is swarms, war beasts or war machines."

The Muster List,667,https://tow.whfb.app/warhammer-armies/the-muster-list,"Rulebook, p. 276","A muster list is a list, written by the player, of all the units that make up the army they will be using during a game. A muster list should include the size of each unit (i.e., how many models it contains at the start of the battle), the equipment those models carry, and any optional upgrades that have been included, be they equipment, command models, magic items and so forth.Most importantly, the muster list should include the total points value of each unit and of the army as a whole, thus ensuring that your army is within the agreed size! Players should share their muster lists with one another before deployment.More DetailMany players find it useful to include greater detail in their muster lists – model and weapon profiles, special rules, even spell and magic item descriptions. Including such detail is by no means necessary, but will reduce how much time is spent flicking through the pages of books during a game."
Army Lists,668,https://tow.whfb.app/warhammer-armies/army-lists,"Rulebook, p. 277","Each faction in Warhammer: the Old World has an army list. This gives profiles and rules for all of the models that make up that faction. An army list is broken down into six parts, though not all of these will be present in every army list. Some armies, for example, do not include any chariots, whilst others might shun the use of war machines:CharactersInfantryCavalryChariotsMonstersWar Machines"
Army Composition Lists,669,https://tow.whfb.app/warhammer-armies/army-composition-lists,"Rulebook, p. 277",An 'army composition list' tells you what role the various units from your army list fulfil within your army. There are two types of army composition list:Grand ArmyArmy of Infamy
Grand Army,670,https://tow.whfb.app/warhammer-armies/grand-army,"Rulebook, p. 277",This is the default army composition list for each faction. Using this army composition list to write your muster list will give you the widest variety of units to choose from and create a broad and balanced force.
Army of Infamy,671,https://tow.whfb.app/warhammer-armies/army-of-infamy,"Rulebook, p. 277","These are supplementary and characterful army composition lists. They differ from the Grand Army in a number of ways, often omitting some of the units available to the Grand Army and instead focussing on a particular type of unit or upon those units favoured by an army drawn from a certain region. Army of Infamy composition lists allow you to create more specialised armies at the expense of a degree of tactical flexibility."
Understanding Army Composition Lists,672,https://tow.whfb.app/warhammer-armies/understanding-army-composition-lists,"Rulebook, p. 277","An army composition list is broken down into a number of categories, each listing the units that belong to it:Characters: The characters that lead your army, powerful individuals possessed of fearsome martial or magical might.Core: The heart of your army, the iconic troops who make up the bulk of every warband and warhost.Special: Skilled and veteran troops, capable of anchoring a battle line of lesser warriors, or performing great deeds in their own right.Rare: The most unusual models in your army, mighty monsters, weird war machines and elite soldiers of unsurpassed skill.In addition, many army composition lists will include one or both of the following categories:Mercenaries: Some armies can include specific units drawn from other army lists as mercenaries.Allies: Most armies can include an allied contingent drawn from another army list."
Percentages,673,https://tow.whfb.app/warhammer-armies/percentages,"Rulebook, p. 278","Each category of a composition list is accompanied by a percentage. This is the percentage of points that you either can or must spend on units drawn from that category. In the case of Grand Army composition lists, these percentages are quite uniform. For example:Characters (up to 50%)Core (at least 25%)Special (up to 50%)Rare (up to 25%)Mercenaries (up to 20%)Allies (up to 25% may be spent on a single allied contingent)This means that, in a 2,000 point army, you would have to spend a minimum of 500 points (25% of 2,000 points) on Core units. By contrast, the most you could spend on Special units would be 1,000 points (50% of 2,000 points)."
Number of Units,674,https://tow.whfb.app/warhammer-armies/number-of-units,"Rulebook, p. 278","Next to the names of some units as they appear in the various army composition lists are numbers, and these require some explanation.In some cases, this may be a number range, 0-2 for example, indicating that an army built using this composition list may contain between zero and two units made up of this type of model.In other cases, the name may be preceded by a number followed by a '+' symbol, 1+ for example, indicating that an army must contain at least one unit made up of that type of model.In some rare cases, you might encounter the term 'up to X per 1,000 points', with 'X' being a number. For example, up to 3 per 1,000 points, indicating that an army may contain no more than three units made up of that type of model for every full 1,000 points of army size.If no such number or range of numbers is present, there is no minimum or maximum to how many units made up of that type of model your army can include."
Named Characters (Warhammer Armies),675,https://tow.whfb.app/warhammer-armies/named-characters-warhammer-armies,"Rulebook, p. 278","Many armies have access to named characters from the Warhammer world. These are usually mighty warriors and powerful leaders, often with unique equipment and their own special rules. As each of these represents an individual, an army can only contain one of each named character."
Mercenaries (Warhammer Armies),676,https://tow.whfb.app/warhammer-armies/mercenaries-warhammer-armies,"Rulebook, p. 279","Some army composition lists include a 'mercenaries' section, which lists a number of units from different army lists. These units can be 'hired' from those army lists to fight for your army as mercenaries. Using mercenaries in this way can greatly enhance the appearance and character of your army, as well as improve its fighting abilities.Any mercenary unit included in this way gains the Mercenaries special rule."

Types of Alliance,682,https://tow.whfb.app/warhammer-armies/types-of-alliance,"Rulebook, p. 281","The vast majority of alliances between an army and an allied contingent are made between trusted allies.

Regimental Units & Detachments,685,https://tow.whfb.app/warhammer-armies/regimental-units-and-detachments,"Rulebook, p. 282","Some armies of the Old World are particularly well-drilled, their units acting in support of one another with a discipline that shames their more chaotic and unruly foes. It is not uncommon to see large and imposing units flanked by smaller detachments. These detachments can prove invaluable by guarding the vulnerable flanks of their parent units, firing in their defence and, in some cases, counter-charging to disrupt the enemy."
Using Regiments & Detachments,686,https://tow.whfb.app/warhammer-armies/using-regiments-and-detachments,"Rulebook, p. 282","In some army lists, certain units will have the option to be accompanied by up to two smaller support units known as 'detachments'. Such units are known as 'regimental units' and are marked by having the 'Regimental Unit' special rule. Units that can be taken as detachments are marked by having the 'Detachment' special rule.In some cases, a model may have both special rules. This simply means that a unit consisting entirely of such models can be either a detachment or a regimental unit. It cannot be both, however, and you must ensure it is clear when writing your muster list which rule the unit will use (if either). You should also ensure this is made clear to your opponent during deployment."
Creating a Regimental Unit,687,https://tow.whfb.app/warhammer-armies/creating-a-regimental-unit,"Rulebook, p. 282","Creating a regimental unit is simple – when writing your muster list, simply create a unit with the 'Regimental Unit' special rule as you normally would and make a note of the detachments that accompany that unit.

Creating a Detachment,688,https://tow.whfb.app/warhammer-armies/creating-a-detachment,"Rulebook, p. 282","To create a detachment, simply choose a unit with the 'Detachment' special rule and create a unit as follows:A detachment can range in size from a minimum of five models to a maximum of half the number of models in the regimental unit it accompanies (rounding down).The models in a detachment can purchase any optional upgrades listed as normal.A detachment cannot include a command group or any command models.A detachment must accompany a regimental unit. This means that every detachment included in your army must be assigned to a regimental unit and a note made of this on your muster list. A detachment cannot be assigned to more than one regimental unit.Detachments are normal units in all regards that benefit from additional rules. With the exception of these special rules, detachments are completely separate and independent from their regimental unit (i.e., spells, magic items and special rules affecting the regimental unit do not affect its detachments unless specifically stated otherwise)."

Prepare for Battle,697,https://tow.whfb.app/warhammer-battles/prepare-for-battle,"Rulebook, p. 284","Not all battles are the same – quite the opposite in fact – and the rules given in the following sections attempt to reflect this. This section is broken down into three parts, each covering the three main ways in which games of Warhammer: the Old World can be played. These are:Pitched BattlesThe most straightforward type of game. Two (or more) players decide to play a game, agree a points value for their armies and select a pitched battle scenario to play. Pitched battles allow for wellbalanced armies to meet and determine a victor with the minimum amount of fuss.You will find six pitched battle scenarios. Each of these differs in terms of how armies are deployed and offers different objectives. By using these simple scenarios, you are assured a fun and balanced game that can be set up quickly and easily.Campaign BattlesLinking games together, either by following an unfolding narrative or simply to find the most successful general within a group, is a great way to experience Warhammer: the Old World. Campaign battles often require more preparation and commitment from the players, but the rewards are worth the effort.You will find simple rules and guidelines for linking your games together into a campaign. Future supplements will present far more in-depth campaign rules, from simple ladder campaigns, to map based campaigns and even unfolding quests and campaigns of conquest in which armies battle to complete objectives and earn rewards.Narrative BattlesThis is a very broad category, often also described as 'open play'. Each of the pitched battle scenarios includes rules for playing a historical recreation of a famous battle from the Warhammer world. These introduce the simplest form of narrative battle – one that recreates history. The challenge of such battles is to see if you could have led your forces to a different outcome than your imagined counterpart did in the history books of this fantasy realm.You will find guidance on taking your narrative games further. This includes suggestions for plots and objectives, as well as more explanation of the role a 'games master' can play and how their presence can enhance the experience for everyone involved."

The following additional caveats also apply:Units that are not normally allowed to move (for example, if they contain models with a Movement characteristic of 0) are placed touching the battlefield edge.Characters can choose to either enter the battle on their own or as part of a unit they have joined. If dice are used to determine when and where reserves enter, state if a character is joining a unit before making any rolls. If so, make a single roll for both character and unit."
First Turn,704,https://tow.whfb.app/warhammer-battles/first-turn,"Rulebook, p. 286","How to determine which player takes the first turn is detailed in each scenario. In most scenarios, the winner of a roll-off chooses who takes the first turn."

Victory Points,708,https://tow.whfb.app/warhammer-battles/victory-points,"Rulebook, p. 286","Most scenarios use 'Victory Points' to determine the winner. In order to win, one player must score at least 100 Victory Points more than their opponent – if one player scores twice as many Victory Points as their opponent, that player has achieved a crushing victory!

Dead or Fled,709,https://tow.whfb.app/warhammer-battles/dead-or-fled,"Rulebook, p. 286","The most usual way to win Victory Points is by destroying, routing or significantly reducing the fighting strength of enemy units:Each enemy unit that has been destroyed or that has fled off the battlefield is worth a number of Victory Points equal to 100% of its points cost.Each enemy unit that is fleeing at the end of the battle is worth a number of Victory Points equal to 50% of its points cost (rounding fractions up). For example, a unit that cost your opponent 351 points to field would be worth 176 Victory Points to you if it is fleeing when the battle ends.Each enemy unit that has been reduced to less than 25% of its starting Unit Strength at the end of the battle is worth a number of Victory Points equal to 25% of its points cost (rounding fractions up)."
The King is Dead,710,https://tow.whfb.app/warhammer-battles/the-king-is-dead,"Rulebook, p. 286","If the enemy General is slain, has fled off the battlefield or is fleeing when the game ends, you win a bonus of 100 Victory Points."

Historical Recreation,715,https://tow.whfb.app/warhammer-battles/historical-recreation,"Rulebook, p. 287","As mentioned previously, each pitched battle scenario includes guidance to recreate the historical battle that inspired it. In addition, the introduction to each scenario gives a brief description of the battle, telling why it was fought and the outcome. Here you will learn which armies to use along with suggestions of certain models or units to include in order to represent historical figures or famous regiments. They may also specify certain terrain features to include, or present special rules to use, the better to reflect the unique circumstances of that battle.These rules are intended for players who want to explore a more narrative style of play and should be treated as ideas to explore freely, rather than as strict rules which must be adhered to. The challenge of such games is simple – were you the general on that fateful day, would the history books record a different outcome?"
Choosing a Pitched Battle Scenario,716,https://tow.whfb.app/warhammer-battles/choosing-a-pitched-battle-scenario,"Rulebook, p. 287","There are two methods players can use to decide a pitched battle scenario prior to a game. The first method is for the players to simply discuss the matter and agree which scenario to use. This gives the maximum amount of choice and ensures that you don't end up with a scenario that neither player particularly wants to play.The second method is to choose randomly, by rolling a D6 and consulting the Pitched Battle table shown below:D6Scenario1Open Battle2Break Point3Flank Attack4Meeting Engagement5Mountain Pass6Command & Control"
Open Battle,717,https://tow.whfb.app/warhammer-battles/open-battle,"Rulebook, p. 288","In the Warhammer world, disputes are settled upon the bloody field of battle. In ideal circumstances, armies will form up across a wide open plain, awaiting the dawn light for the commencement of hostilities. As dusk draws in, one side will often stand victorious, though it is not uncommon for a close fought battle to result in both sides retreating into the gloom to count their losses.This scenario represents a classic battle fought between two rival armies meeting at an ideal location for a day of fighting.Set-upPlace terrain as described.DeploymentOnce the battlefield has been set up, the winner of a roll-off chooses which player will deploy the first unit. The winner of this roll-off must also choose their deployment zone (A or B), as shown on the map opposite. Players deploy their armies using the alternating units method.First TurnOnce deployment is complete, the winner of a roll-off takes the first turn. The player that finished deploying their army first adds +1 to their roll.Game LengthBefore the game begins, players can choose to play a 'fixed' length game or a 'random' length game:Fixed Game Length: The battle will last for six rounds, until one side concedes, or until the time limit agreed by the players is reached.Random Game Length: The battle will last a random number of rounds or until one side concedes. Starting at the end of the fifth round, roll a D6 at the end of each round. Add the round number to the dice roll. If the total is 10 or more, the battle ends immediately. If the total is less than 10 then the battle continues for at least one more round.Scenario Special RulesThis scenario has no special rules.Victory!Once the battle has ended, use Victory Points to determine which player is the winner.Historical RecreationThe Battle of L'Anguille Plain was fought between a vast horde of Orcs and the glittering splendour of the knights of Bretonnia. Both sides were led by mighty warlords – the Orcs by Warboss Durgath Spine Cracker and the Bretonnians by King Louen Orc-Slayer. To reflect this, each army should be led by an appropriate character acting as the General. Warboss Durgath may fight on foot or may be mounted on a boar. King Louen must be mounted on a warhorse.In addition, and to capture a measure of the size and splendour of the armies, a historical recreation should be played with armies of no less than 3,000 points.The bulk of Waaagh! Durgath famously broke formation early, displaying a proper Orcish desire to engage the enemy. However, this ill-disciplined charge into heavy bow fire caused the Orcs to lose much of their advantage and, eventually, the battle. To represent this, the Orc player will automatically take the first turn. In addition, any unit with the Impetuous special rule must declare a charge on a roll of 1-4 (rather than the usual 1-3)."
Break Point,718,https://tow.whfb.app/warhammer-battles/break-point,"Rulebook, p. 290","Some battles are bitter affairs, fought between armies that offer no quarter and will expect no mercy. Where a pitched battle might end after several hours with both armies falling back, a battle fought until break point will rage on until one side is literally broken and destroyed, its scattered remnants cut down by pursuing enemies. Of the losing side, there is seldom little trace left come the morrow.This scenario represents a battle fought to the grim death – a battle not unlike a pitched battle, but one that will rage until one side is forced to concede.Set-upPlace terrain as described.DeploymentOnce the battlefield has been set up, the winner of a roll-off chooses which player will deploy the first unit. The winner of this roll-off must also choose their deployment zone (A or B), as shown on the map opposite. Players deploy their armies using the  alternating units method.First TurnOnce deployment is complete, the winner of a roll-off takes the first turn. The player that finished deploying their army first adds +1 to their roll.Game LengthThere is no turn limit for this scenario. Instead, the battle will last until one side reaches its 'break point' or until one side concedes.Scenario Special RulesBreak Point: All armies have a breaking point. This is equal to a quarter (25%) of the total Unit Strength of the army at the start of the game. To calculate the break point of your army, simply add together the Unit Strength of every unit (including characters) in your muster list and divide the total by four, rounding fractions down.With each model removed from play as a casualty and with each unit destroyed, an army approaches its break point. If, during any Start of Turn sub-phase, the remaining Unit Strength of either army has fallen below its break point, that army is considered to have 'broken'. At this point, the game ends as models begin to flee, crumble into dust, dematerialise, and so forth.Note that units that have pursued a fleeing enemy off the battlefield and units held in reserve count as being on the battlefield for the purposes of determining whether or not an army has reached its break point.Victory!If the game ends with one army having broken, the unbroken army achieves a crushing victory. Should both armies fall below their break point at the same time, use Victory Points to determine which player is the winner.Historical RecreationThe Doom of Odo Todmeyer III took place deep within the Forest of Shadows. To represent this, you should endeavour to include as many woods as possible when setting up the battlefield. The battle was fought between the remnants of the Grand Army of Osterlund (an Empire army) and a much larger force of Beastmen. The Grand Army of Osterlund was led by Odo Todmeyer III, who should be represented by an Empire General mounted on a warhorse.The Beastmen far outnumbered the Grand Army of Osterlund. To reflect this, the Beastman player should have at least 25% more points to spend on their army than their opponent. However, much of this army emerged from the dark woods to entrap the Osterlunders. Therefore, at least half of all Beastman units with either the Ambushers or the Beastmen Ambush special rule should be held in reserve."
Flank Attack,719,https://tow.whfb.app/warhammer-battles/flank-attack,"Rulebook, p. 292","Sometimes a cunning general will divide their strength, sending a portion of their army to range wide in order to outflank the enemy. Such tactics are sound and, if all goes well, are likely to deliver a swift victory. But there are times when an equally cunning enemy has the same plan.This scenario represents a battle in which both armies have assigned a number of units the task of outflanking the enemy. As these flanking forces choose their angle of attack in secret, there is as equal a chance that they will deploy facing one another as there is that they will find the unprotected flank of the main enemy force.Set-upPlace terrain as described.DeploymentOnce the battlefield has been set up, the winner of a roll-off chooses which player will deploy the first unit. The winner of this roll-off must also choose their deployment zone (A or B), as shown on the map opposite. Prior to deployment, both players secretly divide their armies into two forces – the main force and the flanking force:A flanking force must contain at least one non-character unit and can be worth up to 33% of the total points value of the army (for example, in a 2,000 points game, your flanking force may be worth up to 666 points).A flanking force may include characters, but cannot include the General.Once flanking forces have been selected, each player secretly makes a note of which flank (left or right) theirs will be deployed upon. Then, starting with the player that won the roll-off, the players deploy their main forces within their central deployment zone, using the  alternating units method.Finally, after both players have finished deploying their main forces, the players reveal where their flanking forces are to be deployed. Starting with the player that won the roll-off, the players deploy their flanking forces within their chosen 18"" flank zone, using the alternating units method.First TurnOnce deployment is complete, the winner of a roll-off takes the first turn.Game LengthThe battle will last for six rounds, until one side concedes, or until the time limit agreed by the players is reached.Scenario Special RulesOther than the special deployment rules already given, this scenario has no special rules.Victory!Once the battle has ended, use Victory Points to determine which player is the winner.Historical RecreationThe battle of Pine Crags took place within a rocky ravine deep in Athel Loren. To represent this, you should endeavour to include as many woods and areas of rocky terrain (be they difficult, dangerous or impassable) as possible when setting up the battlefield. The battle was fought between a rag-tag army of Dwarf treasure hunters and a (possibly larger) force of Wood Elves. The Dwarf army should contain very few elite troops (such as Hammerers, Ironbreakers or Irondrakes) and no war machines or Runesmiths. Due to their important role, it must contain a unit of Dwarf Rangers in reserve.The Wood Elves caught the Dwarf army largely by surprise as it marched through Athel Loren, cutting down trees. To represent this, the Wood Elf player will automatically take the first turn."
Meeting Engagement,720,https://tow.whfb.app/warhammer-battles/meeting-engagement,"Rulebook, p. 294","It is not uncommon for two armies to cross paths unexpectedly and immediately deploy from Marching Columns into battle lines. More often than not, the fighting starts while rear elements of the armies are still marching towards the battlefield. In such a sudden clash, there is little time for careful consideration or planning.This scenario represents a battle fought between marching armies, in which the outcome can hinge upon the timely arrival of reserve forces and where the initial battle lines can be most uneven.Set-upPlace terrain as described.DeploymentOnce the battlefield has been set up, the winner of a roll-off chooses which player will deploy the first unit. The winner of this roll-off must also choose their deployment zone (A or B), as shown on the map opposite.Before deploying their army, each player rolls a D6 for each unit, including each character and war machine, in their army. On a roll of 1, the unit must be held back as reserves (see below). Once a roll has been made for each unit, those that are not held in reserve can be deployed. Players deploy their armies using the  alternating units method.First TurnOnce deployment is complete, the winner of a roll-off takes the first turn. The player that finished deploying their army first adds +1 to their roll.Game LengthThe battle will last for six rounds, until one side concedes, or until the time limit agreed by the players is reached.Scenario Special RulesReserves: Reserves are not deployed at the start of the battle. Instead they can enter play during the Compulsory Moves sub-phase of any turn – other than the first – of their controlling player's choosing. When they arrive, reserves may enter the battlefield from any point on the long battlefield edge within their deployment zone, and move on using the rules for reinforcements.Victory!Once the battle has ended, use Victory Points to determine which player is the winner.Historical RecreationThe Drakwald Forest incident was a battle fought between two armies of the Empire from rival provinces towards the end of a civil war that had raged for a thousand years. The army of Reikland should include a Witch Hunter, representing the firebrand Dietrich Haslav, whose actions arguably sparked the incident. In addition, the Reikland army should include at least one unit of Greatswords to accompany its General, a captain representing Magda Rassel, and might also include one unit of Flagellants to represent the Witch Hunter's followers. The army of Talabecland should be led by a captain, representing the famed Leonard van Obelmann.Both armies should include plenty of State Troops, the better to represent two forces on patrol. Both armies may include war machines. Ideally, neither should include any knights (of any type) or Wizards as there is no suggestion any were present.Finally, to better capture the nature of the battle, units arriving as reserves that are arrayed in Close Order or Open Order formations should be deployed in Marching Columns."
Mountain Pass,721,https://tow.whfb.app/warhammer-battles/mountain-pass,"Rulebook, p. 296","Many of the kingdoms of the Warhammer world are separated by towering mountain ranges that can only be crossed at the occasional mountain pass. These narrow defiles are of vital strategic importance, and present a defender with the perfect location to confront an invading army.This scenario represents a battle fought in such a pass. The battlefield is long but narrow, making simple manoeuvres difficult and outflanking almost impossible. Consequently, such battles become matters of attrition in which only the most courageous will prevail.Set-upPlace terrain as described.DeploymentOnce the battlefield has been set up, the winner of a roll-off chooses which player will deploy the first unit.

If the total is less than 10 then the battle continues for at least one more round.Scenario Special RulesBottleneck: The battle is fought in a narrow mountain pass enclosed by high cliffs. Because of this, the long battlefield edges count as impassable terrain. As such, no units (including fleeing units or any arriving from reserve) can leave or enter the battlefield via either long edge unless they have the Ethereal or Fly special rule.Victory!Once the battle has ended, use Victory Points to determine which player is the winner.Historical RecreationThe battle of Gisoreux Gap was a brutal affair fought between two elite and well-equipped armies (all that toll money had to go somewhere!). The Bretonnian army should contain a high number of units of Knights. Any units of Men-at-Arms might be given heavy armour to represent the wealth of their lord and their superior position as guards of an important trade route. The Empire army, being an army of Westerland, a province famed for its use of mercenaries, may include any number of units of Veteran State Troops, provided all have the Mercenaries special rule. To help reflect the bitter nature of the battle and the inability of troops to simply turn tail and flee, players may give up to half of their units the Stubborn special rule.Both armies should be led by a General mounted on a warhorse, representing Sir Desfleuve and Countess Bergbrech respectively. Historically, there is no evidence that the two fought single combat during the battle, but, as the battle was a matter of honour, players should spare no efforts to ensure a challenge is fought between their Generals."
Command & Control,722,https://tow.whfb.app/warhammer-battles/command-and-control,"Rulebook, p. 298","The Old World is dotted with many important landmarks, be they watchtowers, arcane monoliths, grand mausoleums and more besides. Many battles are fought around such landmarks, and very often control of the feature is a great boon to an army, either in terms of morale, position, or something more ethereal.This scenario represents a battle fought for control of a special feature – a significant terrain feature at the centre of the table. This may be any special feature.Set-upPlace terrain as described. In addition, place a single special feature in the centre of the battlefield (players should agree which special feature to use from the terrain available).DeploymentOnce the battlefield has been set up, the winner of a roll-off chooses which player will deploy the first unit.

The player that controls the special feature at the end of the battle wins a bonus of 200 Victory Points (in addition to any bonus controlling the special feature may normally give).Historical RecreationThe battle of the Lonely Reaver's Point watchtower was by no means a grand affair. It was fought between lowly peasants, eking a meagre existence as fishermen along the hostile coastline of Bretonnia, and a ragtag warband of Goblin raiders, likely forced down from the Pale Sisters by Orc aggression. The armies used to recreate the battle, then, should be equally humble.The Bretonnian army should contain no knights of any type – only peasant soldiers. The Goblin army should contain no Orcs of any type – only Goblins. Beyond this, there are no restrictions, and including war machines and Wizards will only add to the chaotic fun and confusion.This should be a fun battle to recreate and, more than any other discussed in this section, players are encouraged to abandon army composition rules, and even points values, when recreating the Lonely Tower. The less constrained by such rules the players are, the more fun the game will be."
Campaign Battles,723,https://tow.whfb.app/campaign-battles,"Rulebook, p. 300","Linking games through a story, map or some other method is considered the ideal way to enjoy Warhammer: the Old World by many players. In such campaigns, each individual game represents but one battle fought in an ongoing war and there are plenty of excuses to enjoy challenging and varied games.Many stories of the Warhammer world are told through campaign books, supplements and other publications which present exciting tales of epic deeds. Such publications present rules for recreating famous battles of history, translating them from the page to the tabletop.Often, campaigns are about conquering lands, with each player controlling multiple armies of the same faction, located in different regions. Each rival faction attempts to build its own dominion, increasing the size and strength of its armies and holdings. Such campaigns quickly turn bloody, as armies march forth to invade the lands of their neighbours.As victorious armies seize land, the defeated forces must retreat, regroup and rebuild their strength. This adds new strategic and tactical challenges as a player attempts to outmanoeuvre and outmatch their foes on the campaign map as well as the battlefield.Campaigns can be complex, involving many battles over many months and including rules for lines of supply, sieges, allies and spies, perhaps even random events such as plagues or rampaging monsters. Alternatively, a campaign can be quite a simple affair, with only a few parameters influencing the scenarios used in a small number of linked games."
Campaign Trees,724,https://tow.whfb.app/campaign-battles/campaign-trees,"Rulebook, p. 300","The most simple type of campaign that two players can enjoy is one that uses a campaign tree, such as the one shown in the example below. In such a campaign, the outcome of each battle determines the scenario that will be used for the next game. Should players wish, they may add a few caveats regarding how their armies might change for each battle with each win or loss."
League Campaigns,725,https://tow.whfb.app/campaign-battles/league-campaigns,"Rulebook, p. 301","For many players, finding the time to devote to a long and involved campaign can prove a challenge, with the requirements of real life all too often making it difficult to commit to for fear of letting down friends. For others, the mere thought of running a campaign can itself be daunting – creating a map, keeping track of the battles fought and so on can seem like a tremendous undertaking.In such cases, players may wish to partake in a simple league campaign. In such a campaign, each participant simply plays each other participant once (or twice, or thrice, if everyone is keen enough) and records the results. At the end of the campaign, the player with the most Campaign Points is declared the winner."
Scoring,726,https://tow.whfb.app/campaign-battles/scoring,"Rulebook, p. 301","In order to determine a winner, each participant in a league campaign wins a number of Campaign Points (CP) after each battle, based upon their performance:Crushing Victory3 CPVictory2 CPDraw1 CPLoss0 CPShould any players be tied at the end of the campaign, particularly if they are tied for the top spot, their overall Victory Points can be used as a tiebreaker – although by far the most satisfying way to settle a tie is with a final battle between two would-be conquerors."
Taking It Further,727,https://tow.whfb.app/campaign-battles/taking-it-further,"Rulebook, p. 301","For some added depth, the players within a league campaign may be split into two opposing teams, or 'alliances'. At the end of the campaign, the alliance with the most Campaign Points is declared the winner and can be crowned alongside the winning player (who may not even belong to the winning alliance). In this way, players can work together to overcome their enemies and mitigate the impact of individual defeats.In conjunction with a simple campaign tree, the performance of each alliance can be used to determine the scenario played in each round of the campaign. Should you wish, some of the games played can be multi-player battles, with two or more allied players facing off against an equal number of foes.As the action unfolds, the alliances will build bonds that strengthen over time, savouring their allies' wins and lamenting their losses as bitterly as their own, and fierce enmities will appear between opposing armies which can be built upon as part of a more complex campaign in the future. Very quickly, the seeds of a simple league campaign can provide more than enough narrative content for a more involved campaign."
Narrative Battles,728,https://tow.whfb.app/narrative-battles,"Rulebook, p. 302","The Warhammer world is a dark land of heroic deeds and astonishing tales. Adventurous players can use their battles to fight out these incredible stories for themselves, or to tell their own stories, based upon the exploits of the cunning and bold leaders of their own armies. The following sections aim to provide some ideas and suggestions to inform the reader and inspire them to try some different types of game.Part of what makes Warhammer: the Old World great is the richly described and vibrant background of the Old World itself. Imagine your game taking place within a dark clearing deep inside the Drakwald Forest, as morning mist curls through the dense trees and the sun lies hidden behind the dark canopy, whilst all around dark things stir and foul forces gather. What if the unexpected occurred? A new threat might arrive in the midst of a battle, such as packs of Ghouls, drawn by the carrion feast, creeping onto the battlefield from its treelined edges to set upon the undefended archers at the rear of your army.The possibilities are limitless, but how can you add such events into your games?"
What is a Narrative Battle?,729,https://tow.whfb.app/narrative-battles/what-is-a-narrative-battle,"Rulebook, p. 302","The term 'narrative battle' describes any battle that allows players to explore the background by adding new rules to the game or by foregoing rules that seem restrictive in the circumstances. Of course, there is nothing wrong with simply fighting a battle for the sake of it – the game is there to be enjoyed in all its forms, and it can be argued that any game has a degree of narrative behind it as almost all players will imagine the action unfolding in cinematic scope within their mind's eye. A narrative battle is one that expands upon this, drawing both players into a shared story.This can be done in a number of ways – by adding a story that sets the backdrop for the forthcoming battle, by adding scenario special rules or victory conditions (be they drawn from another scenario or source, or be they especially written by the players) that make the characters, armies or environment better evoke the story. In this way the battle itself completes the 'tale' begun by the scenario."
Historical Recreations,730,https://tow.whfb.app/narrative-battles/historical-recreations,"Rulebook, p. 302","The simplest examples of a narrative battle are the historical recreations presented in the pitched battle scenarios. By simply following the guidance given there, by using appropriate armies and terrain, you can attempt to recreate that historic event."
Custom Scenarios,731,https://tow.whfb.app/narrative-battles/custom-scenarios,"Rulebook, p. 302","Some players may wish to create their own scenarios, either by utilising different elements of the pitched battles scenarios, or by creating their own special rules. Such scenarios can be assembled to tell a simple story, and you will find a table of narrative motives intended to provide ideas for your own games."
Narrative Scenarios,732,https://tow.whfb.app/narrative-battles/narrative-scenarios,"Rulebook, p. 302","There are many examples of narrative scenarios to be found in Warhammer: the Old World supplements. These provide unique deployment maps and maps of terrain to recreate, along with special rules to use. Narrative scenarios tend to be created along the lines of historical recreations, giving guidance as to the forces to use in order to represent the battle the scenario describes. But, as with the pitched battle scenarios, narrative scenarios can be played with any combination of armies."
Open Play,733,https://tow.whfb.app/narrative-battles/open-play,"Rulebook, p. 303","A term used often in conjunction with narrative battles is 'open play', but what does it mean? Open play means many things, but in essence it refers to the philosophy wherein players treat the rules as a guideline to be aided by, rather than a set of constrictions to restrict them."
Armies of Imagination,734,https://tow.whfb.app/narrative-battles/armies-of-imagination,"Rulebook, p. 303","One key aspect of open play is that it grants the freedom to forego certain army composition rules in pursuit of the narrative. At its most simple, players will often ignore percentages and other restrictions when creating their armies, choosing instead to write a muster list that best fits the narrative. Taking it further, some players will ignore points values altogether, and instead field opposing armies created purely to fit into their story.Of course, ignoring such rules can lead to an imbalanced match-up, and this thought may be unappealing to some players. This is perfectly acceptable and any group of players is encouraged to use the suggestions given here, or not, as they see fit. However, these imbalances can often prove part of the charm of a narrative battle, and can invariably be countered by special rules and objectives. Ignoring points values might lead to an army being outnumbered ten to one, for example, and that army might reasonably be expected to suffer a crushing defeat and terrible losses. But the challenge of the game might be to hold out until turn four – perhaps that will grant a vital messenger sufficient time to escape, carrying word of the size of the invading army, and thus the terrible defeat can be claimed as a victory (of sorts)."
"""Think Of Them More As Guidelines""",735,https://tow.whfb.app/narrative-battles/think-of-them-more-as-guidelines,"Rulebook, p. 303","Another key aspect of open play is that it gives players permission to change a rule if doing so will improve the experience in the moment. For example, a vital unit might unexpectedly lose combat and Break, causing the game to end suddenly and unsatisfyingly. Of course, such is the way of things and there is no altering that. However, sometimes players encountering such an event might agree to alter the outcome of the Break test, perhaps allowing the defeated unit to instead Fall Back in Good Order. Doing so might extend the game and, more importantly, might feel like the more correct outcome in the circumstances.By way of another example, imagine a battle fought under the gloom of twilight. In such conditions, shooting may reasonably be expected to be less effective. To evoke this, players may add a rule, perhaps agreeing that all long range shooting suffers an additional -1 To Hit modifier, or perhaps agreeing that the Range characteristic of all missile weapons should be reduced.Whatever the case, players – especially good friends who know one another well – are encouraged to make amendments to the rules before or during a game if doing so will help to enforce the narrative. Provided both players are having fun and are in agreement, such amendments and alterations can lead to some truly memorable moments."
The Games Master,736,https://tow.whfb.app/narrative-battles/the-games-master,"Rulebook, p. 304","One of the best ways to introduce new rules or ideas and to run a narrative scenario is with the help of a Games Master. A Games Master (or GM for short) is an optional third player who takes a role somewhere between that of a narrator and of an impartial arbitrator of the rules, who presides over and runs a particular battle. The GM helps the players by setting up the scenario and interpreting and amending – or even making up – the rules as needed."
The Role of a GM,737,https://tow.whfb.app/narrative-battles/the-role-of-a-gm,"Rulebook, p. 304","The role a Games Master takes will vary from group to group. It may be a blend of all the points that follow or be something else entirely, as the players and their games require.An Unbiased ObserverThe role of GM can be to simply observe the game and offer an impartial opinion on any uncertainties that arise. Players can share secrets with the GM, such as the predetermined point that reinforcements will arrive from, or where Scouts are deployed in hiding. With a GM's help, entire armies can even be deployed in secret.A Narrator & StorytellerSome groups will be fortunate enough to include a member gifted in storytelling and the creation of unique scenarios. This can be utilised by allowing the individual, acting as GM, to set the scene and talk the players through the action as it unfolds. Should the game take an unexpected turn, a skilled GM can either alter the narrative to accommodate this, or gently nudge the action back onto the intended track.An Arbiter of the RulesFor many, the role of GM is of someone who forges and re-forges the rules throughout a game to maintain the flow of the action. When taken in conjunction with the telling of an unfolding story, this can result in many unusual events happening, creating some truly memorable moments.An Impartial Third PlayerImagine a group of skirmishers moving through a wood have disturbed the lair of a terrible beast, or the noise of a battle in an underground realm has awoken a slumbering Dragon. In such cases, these wandering monsters can be controlled by the GM. There may even be a third force involved in the game somehow, controlled by the GM.Fate's RepresentativeSometimes, a battle might need nudging along in a certain direction, and if the game is part of a campaign, this might be especially important. In such cases, a GM might choose to help one of the players in small ways, or to hinder another. Ideally, this should only be done when the action requires it.The presence of a GM can add many extra levels to your games, and players are encouraged to give it a try – no one knows until they do just how much fun the role can be or who will be best at it."
Forging a Narrative,738,https://tow.whfb.app/narrative-battles/forging-a-narrative,"Rulebook, p. 305","One enjoyable aspect of narrative battles is the creation of scenarios that help tell tales of the noble and ignoble adventures of the armies in your collection. Creating a scenario can be as simple as mixing and matching elements of different published scenarios. Alternatively, you may wish to go further still, creating your own deployment maps and victory conditions.But what of the story itself? Why are these armies meeting to do battle and where is this battle taking place? The following sections offer some suggestions for the two most important aspects of any narrative scenario: the location and the motive."
Narrative Locations,739,https://tow.whfb.app/narrative-battles/narrative-locations,"Rulebook, p. 305","The table below suggests six locations in which a battle could be fought. Using these, you can create a thematic battlefield that offers unique challenges. It is also possible (even encouraged) to combine these ideas in different ways:D6Result1Riverbank: One side of the battlefield (short or long) can be treated as impassable terrain, representing the fast flowing waters. Perhaps two adjacent edges could be impassable terrain, representing the battle taking place where the river bends. Such a battlefield might feature areas of difficult or dangerous terrain, representing the muddy banks.2Forest Glade: The battlefield might be ringed around its edge with woods. The dense wood might cause reserves to get lost in the forest and arrive at randomly determined locations. The same may be true of units that pursue the enemy off the battlefield – they may become lost and not return immediately, if at all.3Mountain Fastness: The battlefield should be long and narrow, and at least two of its edges treated as impassable terrain. The rest of the battlefield might be populated with difficult and dangerous terrain in the form of rocky ground. If the ground is steep, the entire battlefield could count as sloping away from one edge, giving an advantage to the side that controls it.4Underground Cavern: An underground battle might be a tense and claustrophobic affair fought on a smaller than average battlefield with one or two points of access. Flying creatures are unlikely to be of much use, and war machines of certain types might prove ineffective. In fact, in the dark all missile weapons might be of limited use.5Marshland: The majority of the battlefield can be treated as difficult terrain, with the only areas of open ground being low hills that rise from the mire. Cavalry and monsters may find such a battlefield especially difficult. Banks of mist might drift through the air, obscuring line of sight before dispersing, making units unsure where exactly the enemy is.6Desert Dunes: A desert battlefield need not be sparse. Hills can represent the shifting dunes; rock formations and ruins can dot the landscape. The heat might sap the strength of heavily armoured units, slowing them down. The glare of the sun might interfere with shooting, whilst unexpected winds and sandstorms can halt all movement and drive away flying creatures."
Narrative Motives,740,https://tow.whfb.app/narrative-battles/narrative-motives,"Rulebook, p. 306","The Narrative Motives table presents six reasons why two armies are meeting in conflict. When creating a narrative for the battle, the motive is extremely important. When combined with the location, you are able to say almost everything that needs to be said about the story behind the battle. All that remains is to learn the composition of the armies and the outcome – and these are things best revealed by playing the game.Using the suggestions given here and combining them with the Narrative Locations table, you can create a scenario that gives a battle a true sense of significance:D6Result1Border Dispute: Disagreements over the exact location of a border are common and they can be sparked by almost anything. Such disputes can quickly lead to bloodshed; their outcome can see borders move and cause tremendous upheaval. On the tabletop, a border dispute can be represented very simply with one army trying to drive its rival off and claim victory.2Lost Riches: The world contains many tremendous riches, and sometimes new wealth is discovered or lost wealth unearthed. In game terms, this could be represented by placing several objectives around the battlefield, each representing a cache of buried riches or a natural deposit of precious stones or metals. The winning player would be the one whose army controls the most objectives at the battle’s end.3Nowhere to Run: Tales of desperate last stands by beleaguered armies are the stuff of legend. On the tabletop, an army might be unable to retreat, forced to deploy on the banks of a mighty river or against an impassable cliff face, where it must fight to the death. Alternatively, an army might deploy in the centre of the battlefield, surrounded by its enemy.4Access Rights: Many battles have been fought for control of a stretch of road or river, a bridge or a ford, and many armies have found themselves ambushed en route to their destination. In a game, this might be represented by deploying one army in a narrow column that stretches across the table, with the enemy deployed to either side.5Conquer New Lands: As armies are defeated, their lands are left undefended, presenting vulnerable targets for rivals. Such contests for the control of land can be represented by dividing the battlefield into four quarters, each of which can be controlled by the side that has the most units completely within it. At the end of the battle, the side that controls the most quarters is victorious.6Property Damage: Treasured monuments, important buildings and sacred sites all present valuable targets for an enemy bent upon destruction. On the tabletop, this can be represented by placing a special feature at the centre of the battlefield which the armies fight to control. Alternatively, a special feature can be placed in a well-defended position, with one army attempting to wrest control of the feature from the enemy."
Linked Battles,741,https://tow.whfb.app/narrative-battles/linked-battles,"Rulebook, p. 307","A battle is rarely an isolated event, but instead a single climactic confrontation fought as part of a wider conflict. By linking a series of battles together, it is possible to string a few evenings' worth of games into an ongoing and interconnected narrative that unfolds into a saga worthy of entering the annals of Warhammer history.The idea of linking games together is that the outcome of one battle directly affects the events of the next, making for tactically challenging battles with an exciting and unfolding story. Such linked games encourage players to rethink strategies and consider the big picture of their ongoing battles. It becomes possible to lose a battle, but win the war by keeping the ultimate victory in mind.The games create a natural story arc, and before long the players will have great grudges to settle and vows of redemption to honour. In addition to exploring the narrative elements, it allows for an occasional change of pace as players can use smaller or larger forces than they habitually do and explore different scenarios."
Campaign Narrative,742,https://tow.whfb.app/narrative-battles/campaign-narrative,"Rulebook, p. 307","Readers must by now have realised that there are strong and binding ties between narrative battles and campaign battles, and vice versa. Indeed, a series of linked, narrative battles can very much be considered a campaign. How the players go about answering the questions posed when forging the narrative, and the many others that are certain to arise as that narrative unfolds, informs how these games can progress to become something greater.The GM in a CampaignThe role of a games master in campaign play can also be important. During a campaign, the GM will likely be the person that keeps any maps updated and keeps track of the participants. They are able to wield their power over the narrative on a larger scale as well, steering each step of the campaign towards the end goal, one battle at a time."
The Dark Monolith,743,https://tow.whfb.app/narrative-battles/the-dark-monolith,"Rulebook, p. 307","The following sections present an example of three linked, narrative scenarios. In the first, two rival forces encounter one another unexpectedly whilst searching for the same monument to darkness. In the second, they battle once more for control of the monolith, each enduring the losses inflicted during the previous encounter. In the final scenario, the force that holds the monolith must fight bitterly to defend its prize against enemy reinforcements.This is a simple premise, and much of the detail is left blank, leaving players to decide upon the armies that take part and upon the end goals of each player. Is the goal to destroy the monolith, or to use it for evil? Where do the battles take place? Deep within the Forest of Shadows, or upon the frozen steppes of Kislev? How large are the armies? Are they small patrols roaming the wilderness, or mighty war hosts gathered by powerful lords? These are questions for the players to answer. How they do so is part of the fun.Note that each of the scenarios presented here can be played in isolation should you wish."
First Linked Battle,744,https://tow.whfb.app/narrative-battles/first-linked-battle,"Rulebook, p. 308","Although this scenario is designed to be the first of three linked battles, it can be played alone.Army SelectionIf playing this game as the first of three linked battles, the players should consider that the size of this first game will influence the action in the next two scenarios as well. The armies used in this scenario will be used again in the second and third scenarios.However, in the second game, both players will have to endure losses suffered in the first, meaning that their armies might be considerably smaller, and that one player might have a significant advantage if their losses are fewer. In the third game, one player is almost certain to be dramatically outnumbered as they make a desperate last stand in defence of the dark monolith.That being the case, this first scenario is ideal for armies of between 2,000 and 3,000 points, ensuring that they can withstand a degree of attrition.Players can use any army they wish and may even both field armies of the same type drawn from the same army list. The rival forces, determined in their quest, will view any other force as an enemy and be convinced that its goals are contrary to their own, thus setting the stage for some vicious battles!Set-upPlace terrain as described.DeploymentOnce terrain has been placed, the battlefield is divided into six equally sized zones, as shown on the map opposite.The loser of a roll-off deploys first, placing a single, noncharacter unit so that it is completely within one of the zones. The winner of the roll-off then deploys a single, non-character unit so that it is completely within one of the remaining, unoccupied zones. The players continue to alternate in this fashion until each has deployed three non-character units and there is a single unit within each zone.Following the same sequence, each player may then deploy a single character with one of their deployed units. All remaining units and characters are held in reserve (as follows).First TurnOnce deployment is complete, the winner of a roll-off takes the first turn. The player that finished deploying their army first adds +1 to their roll.Game LengthThe battle will last for six rounds, until one side concedes, or until the time limit agreed by the players is reached.Scenario Special RulesSurprise Battle: Due to the surprise of encountering an unexpected enemy, any unit that wishes to declare a charge during the first round must first pass a Leadership test. If this test is failed, the unit does not count as having declared a charge.Reserves: Reserves are not deployed at the start of the battle. Instead they can enter play during the Compulsory Moves sub-phase of any turn – including the first – of their controlling player's choosing. When they arrive, reserves will enter the battlefield from any point on the battlefield edge that is completely within one of the zones (chosen at random) in which their controlling player deployed a unit at the start of the battle. Roll a D3 to randomly determine which of the three zones reserves arrive within.Victory!Once the battle has ended, use Victory Points to determine which player is the winner."
Second Linked Battle,745,https://tow.whfb.app/narrative-battles/second-linked-battle,"Rulebook, p. 310","Although this scenario is designed to be the second of three linked battles, it can be played alone.Army SelectionIf playing this game as the second of three linked battles, the players must use the same muster lists they used in the first. However, they must roll a D6 for each unit that suffered casualties or was removed from play during the first battle:Units that Suffered Casualties: For each unit that lost more than a quarter (25%) of its Unit Strength during the first battle, roll a D6:On a roll of 1-3, remove:D3 models (to a minimum of Unit Strength 5) if the unit's Unit Strength is 19 or lower.D6 models (to a minimum of Unit Strength 10) if the unit's Unit Strength is 20 or higher.On a roll of 4+, the unit has managed to patch up its wounded and return them to battle. The unit may be fielded at full strength but must reduce its Leadership characteristic by 1.Destroyed Units: For each unit that was removed from play for any reason (such as being destroyed in combat, being run down by an enemy unit whilst fleeing or fleeing off the battlefield) during the first battle, roll a D6:On a roll of 1-2, the surviving members of the unit have scattered to the hills and not yet returned. The unit cannot be fielded in this game.On a roll of 3+, the surviving members of the unit have regrouped. The unit may be fielded, but the number of models it contains is halved (rounding up to the nearest model).Set-upPlace terrain as described. In addition, place a single large hill (ideally more than 12"" at its widest point) in the centre of the battlefield. Atop this hill, place either an arcane monolith or a monument of glory special feature.DeploymentOnce the battlefield has been set up, the winner of a roll-off chooses which player will deploy the first unit. The winner of this roll-off must also choose their deployment zone (A or B), as shown on the map opposite. Players deploy their armies using the alternating units method.First TurnOnce deployment is complete, the winner of a roll-off takes the first turn. The player that finished deploying their army first adds +1 to their roll.Game LengthThe battle will last a random number of rounds or until one side concedes. Starting at the end of the fifth round, roll a D6 at the end of each round. Add the round number to the dice roll. If the total is 10 or more, the battle ends immediately. If the total is less than 10 then the battle continues for at least one more round.Scenario Special RulesOther than the army selection rules already given, this scenario has no special rules.Victory!Once the battle has ended, use Victory Points to determine which player is the winner. The player that controls the special feature at the end of the battle wins a bonus of 200 Victory Points (in addition to any bonus controlling the special feature may normally give)."

The Lores of Magic,747,https://tow.whfb.app/the-lores-of-magic,"Rulebook, p. 319","Wizards are a formidable force on the battlefield, able to wreak incredible destruction, weaken or strengthen other warriors, or summon terrible beasts to fight at their side. The rules for using Wizards and casting spells in your games have already been covered in detail in the Magic section. In the following sections, you will find the Lores of Magic – lists from which Wizards generate their spells.Each Lore of Magic represents a particular approach towards the study and use of magic, giving each a particular character reflected by the spells within it. Different Wizards have access to different Lores of Magic.Every Wizard's rules include the Lore(s) of Magic they know. In some cases, it will be stated that they know spells from a single, given Lore of Magic, whilst in others it will be stated that they know spells from one of a number of given Lores of Magic.

Spells & Spell Generation,748,https://tow.whfb.app/the-lores-of-magic/spells-and-spell-generation,"Rulebook, p. 319","Each player randomly generates spells for each of their Wizards before armies are deployed. If your army contains more than one Wizard, you may generate spells for each in an order of your choosing.Each Lore of Magic contains seven spells: six numbered (1-6) and a seventh 'signature' spell. To determine the spells your Wizard knows, roll a number of D6 equal to their Level of Wizardry, re-rolling any duplicate results. The result(s) show which spell(s) your Wizard knows.If you wish, your Wizard may discard one of these randomly generated spells and instead select the signature spell of their chosen Lore of Magic. Any number of Wizards in your army may do this.Note that Wizards in the same army may know the same spell(s), so individual spells may be duplicated within your army.

Limitations & Uniqueness,808,https://tow.whfb.app/magic-items/limitations-and-uniqueness,"Rulebook, p. 337","As a general rule, most magic items are considered to be quite unique. Even common magic items are, for the most part, common only in that they are available to all races – they are not so common as to be available to each and every character in your army. To represent this, only one of each magic item can be included in your army. In addition, a model can only purchase one magic item from each category.There are, of course, exceptions to this rule of uniqueness.

Such items are seen in great number and, as such, can be purchased alongside other magic items from the same category.

What's in a Name?,812,https://tow.whfb.app/magic-items/whats-in-a-name,"Rulebook, p. 337","The magic items listed on the following sections often have a name that describes them quite specifically, but this does not mean a model has to carry or wear that exact item. The important thing to remember with common magic items is that the rules given represent something that might appear in any army – something with a quite common magical effect, but an appearance unique to the race that created it.For example, in the hands of a General of the Empire, it would make sense for a 'Sword of Striking' to resemble a fine rapier, but when wielded by an Orc Warboss that same rapier would look out of place. It is perfectly acceptable for the model of an Orc Warboss equipped with a Sword of Striking to carry a large and brutal cleaver instead. What matters is that the points have been paid to include the item in your army, and that a suitable weapon is wielded by the model so that your opponent can easily remember what it represents."

Choose Combat & Determine Who Can FightThe active player chooses which order the combats are resolved in. Each combat must be fully resolved before moving onto the next one.

Break TestEach unit belonging to the losing side must make a Break test by rolling 2D6 and applying the difference between the winner and the loser's combat result scores as a negative modifier. Compare the result to the unit's Leadership characteristic:If the result of the natural roll is higher than the unit's Leadership, the unit 'Breaks' and flees.If the result of the natural roll is equal to or lower than the unit's Leadership, but the modified result is higher than the unit's Leadership, the unit Falls Back in Good Order.If the modified result is equal to or lower than the unit's Leadership, or if the roll is a natural double 1, the unit Gives Ground.4. Follow Up & PursuitOnce Break tests have been made, but before any units Give Ground or make a Flee roll, the winning unit(s) must decide what they will do next: restrain and reform, follow up or pursue.Restrain & Reform: A unit that wishes to restrain & reform makes a Restraint test by testing against its Leadership. If this test is passed, it remains where it is and may make a free reform. Otherwise, it must follow up or pursue.Follow Up: If the enemy Gives Ground, the winning unit(s) move forwards to engage it once again. Before following up, a unit may perform a free turn manoeuvre (of 90° or 180°).Pursuit: If the enemy Falls Back in Good Order or flees, the winning unit(s) can pursue.Overrun: If a unit wiped out its enemy, it may overrun by making a pursuit move directly forwards."
